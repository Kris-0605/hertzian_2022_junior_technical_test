IT IS NOT WORKING
I incorrectly identified the problem from before.
The ID generation was fine, it turned out Steam was just giving me duplicate reviews because it returns the same cursor once you reach the end.
I've now added code to remove duplicate reviews.
I believe I can fix the problem of only getting 40 reviews by changing the filter from "most helpful" to "most recent".
However, I could also try increasing the day_range. Either option is possible.
In the event of an actual test, I would ask about this. However, right now I am going to make the decision to do the first option.
