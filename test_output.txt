Something went wrong, at least one test failed.

All tests succeeded, except the one that checks if the review ID is unique.
Conclusion, steam lied about recommendationid being unique.
I will change the ID to instead use a hash of the author's steam ID + the recommendation id + the review content + the timestamp it was posted.
Unless Steam somehow gives two reviews posted with the same content at the same time by the same person the same ID, which would be ridiculous, it should be fine.
