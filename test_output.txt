Test 21 failed
Something went wrong, at least one test failed.

Test 21 still isn't implemented.
Test 20 was fixed by altering it so that the input is midnight on a day, instead of half-way through a day.
The function still works, however the unit test can't work unless this is the case because a review can meet the timestamp requirement, but fail the unit test due to the unit test only reading the date, not the time.
