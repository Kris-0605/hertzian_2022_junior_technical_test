        "content": "It's a spin-off made in-part by Dynasty Warriors developer Omega Force was announced, most folk assumed it would be a Persona-skinned, musou-style action game similar to the studio\u2019s other licensed series like Hyrule Warriors or One Piece: Pirate Warriors. In reality, however, the simple but engaging real-time combat of Persona 5 Strikers is structured much closer to action-JRPGs like Kingdom Hearts, barely resembling a musou game at all.\n\nSo this game, it\u2019s good, great story, and it is much more than a button masher. It beautifully blends rpg action with hack and slash combat. The music is great as always. The only problem I have with this game is most of the time, there\u2019s too much dialogue but I got over it after like the third conversation. The villains are also great. There\u2019s a lot of exploration! Overall, great game. Considering this game is like warriors we could possibly have a few crossover characters and that would be cool, considering they did a crossover with Hatsune Miku in Persona 4 Dancing All Night which was a nice addition to the game.\n10/10",

Though, if you care about story, I would recommend to play it only if you have finished Persona 5 before, since the story itself is a continuation of the story of Persona 5",

The combat is very, VERY good, and actually kinda addicting. In some cases, it rivals the turn-based combat). And the palaces (in this game, they're called jails) are outstanding and just as good as the palaces back in Persona 5.\n\nIf you want the other Persona games to come to PC, buy this.\n\n\nEDIT: we won",

        "content": "Pretty fun, but the grind for the bond exp trophy is a terrible slog that I'm in the midst of. Other than that, my only other complaint is that my Xbox controller is very particular when it comes to this game. You have to wait to connect the controller until the game is running. If you don't, the game will bug out and constantly switch the button icons from Xbox to PS and the button mapping gets funky.\n\nThat aside, this game was a good experience. You'll want to have played P5 or P5R in order to fully grasp the story. The combat was difficult to grasp at first, but after a few hours I got the hang of it, especially after I figured out how to get my controller to work with the game. \n\nWith that being said, I doubt I'll come back to this game after I get all of the achievements for it, or at least not any time soon. It's a great game, and the mainline Persona games are probably my favorite video games of all time, but it doesn't really hold a candle to the mainline games. Most of the enjoyment I got from this game was just getting more Phantom Thieves content.",

        "content": "P5R ON PC OUR DREAMS HAVE COME TRUE\n\nClickbait \u2018title\u2019 aside, Persona 5 Strikers is for sure worth your time coming off either vanilla P5 or P5R. A subtle hint I like about this game is the lack of confidants/social links, with the new BOND system taking its place. It says all the individual bonds between Joker and the rest of the regularly scheduled Phantom Thieves are as \u2018maxed\u2019 as much as possible, being more about enjoying the experiences of their trip around Japan and becoming a tighter group overall as opposed to the compartmentalized substories SLs tend to be. \n\nZenkichi and Sophia are also great additions with great character arcs, the former reminding me of previous Hierophant Arcana characters and their respective daughters, but this one being something the Phantom Thieves have an active, prolonged hand in that makes it feel very believable and relatable. Sohpia is a bit more predictable of an AI gaining sentience, but she still has a very heartwarming personality and conclusion. They both remind me quite a bit of Takuto Maruki, may Billy Kametz rest in piece. \n\nAs someone who has never played a Dynasty Warriors game, I have to say the combination of action and turn based combat from both series is put together seamlessly and the moment to moment gameplay flows perfectly. Baton passing and showtimes really make you feel like working as a team has true benefits and each interaction really brings each PT\u2019s character out, my favorite showtime being Zenkichi\u2019s. \n\nSo yeah, P5S is a great addition to the Persona series, even if a full $60 is a bit steep coming off 120+ hours from Royal. I\u2019d conclude it calling it a very heartwarming experience, that\u2019s the feeling I got from my time with it if I had to describe it in one word. Great straightforward story that lets us see our favorite delinquents again and seamless gameplay that is punchy, cathartic and as stylish and over-the-top as ever. (And of course 10/10 music, especially randomized music from all past mainline Persona games, good one Atlus.)",

        "content": "Ayyyye, I'm back again with another review...I know, I know, who goes from Travis Strikes Again to Persona 5 Strikers? I don't know, I'm just wack with my taste, I guess. Still working on The Silver Case too, and I'm almost done with [i] that [/i] game too. Anyways, it's showtime!:\n\n[h1] The Narrative/Story [/h1]\n\nWell...it's a lot like Persona 5's original story (whether it be Vanilla or Royal, doesn't matter cause they both segway into Strikers.) This time around, you've travelling all around Japan and saving the world once again! Everyone gets their own moments to shine in the story again, which is nice and we do see the development from P5 show up here. It's hard to really comment on as it really just boils down to the Phantom Thieves (along with a couple of members, one of which is unironically one of the best parts about the game.) \n\nThe locations chosen work with the story and the pacing and writing were fine, better than Vanilla 5's writing in my opinion. I think the themes that felt a little tacked on in the original are either written better here or the new themes (like family issues in Haru's case, not going into any spoilers) are decently enough written. The entire of the game....mehhh...it's kinda cheesy, maybe I'm just used to the Persona formula of having happy but sad endings, but it still had me invested through the end.\n\nI'll give it either a A-/B+, it's alright. Not the best writing in the world, but far from the worst...trust me...I'm...not so fond of some of P3's writing in particular, but we'll save that for when Persona 3 Portable gets ported to PC sometime next year...\n\n\n[h1] The Gameplay [/h1]\n\nProbably the best aspect about this game. Being a Muso game (and having played Hyrule Warriors on Wii U a long time ago), I actually really enjoyed this game's gameplay. Sure, after a while, it gets a bit repetitive, but upgrading you and your party members as well as mastering new skills by just doing combos and whatnot freshens the game up a bit, not to mention you're [i] always [/i] getting new Personas and strengthening them, getting them new skills just like in normal P5. A lot of the mechanics carried over quite well to this game and in my opinion, this is one of the best Muso games I've played (which isn't saying much because again, I've only played Hyrule Warriors before this game that was back when the game came out.)\n\nThe only issue I have with it is that if you like doing side content, getting some of the [i] really [/i] good demons and having the best equipment possible for everyone like me, you'll have to do quite a bit of grinding for money and Persona Points (PP for short...kind of an really overused term in RPGs if you ask me.) I'd say it's mostly worth it get to awesome Personas like Yoshitsune, Alice, and Mara and with the ability to pitch which skills to inherit when fusing, skill-swapping for Joker's Personas any time in overworld in the Persona menu, and a constant flow of new Personas, grinding shouldn't be too bad, I'd say money's the biggest issue and even then there's ways around it. So I guess the only complaint I have with it asides from it potential repetitiveness is that it's a little grindy, especially towards the end.\n\nA-, it's pretty solid stuff and I'm genuinely surprised how the mechanics from Persona/SMT carried over into a Hack N' Slash as well as they did here.\n\n[h1] The Visual/Audio Design [/h1]\n\n[i] *Sigh* [/i] Yeah... this is one of the weaker parts of this game. Let me get the graphics out of the way first, though.\n\nVisually, the game looks great! The overworlds are nice and detailed and look great without suffering any performance issues (which surprises me quite a bit given that I've heard Muso games usually have pretty bad PC ports or at least mediocre ones that have their issues) and the effects like the ones seen on the Personas is nice. The menu, while not [i] as [/i] stylish as P5's original menus are still pretty nice here and definitely have their own flair and are relatively easy to navigate (minus the menu before the final boss which was...kind of clunky.) I really can't complain about anything visually with the game, the models are all nice, the FMVs both pre-rendered and animated are quite nice and the game looks pretty good for game that was on Switch and PS4 originally (the former suffering pretty badly from framerate issues from what I've heard.) Point is, it looks good, Atlus did great with this game's visually just as I'd expect them to.\n\nNow the audio....uhhh...well...it's not great. Let's start with the voice-acting. I kinda feel like a few of the cast members forgot how to do their original character's voices, Ryuji sounded kinda off here and there especially and so did Joker, and some of the other character's actual audio sounds quieter or louder than others which is also kind of distracting. You can definitely tell this game was recorded during COVID while the everyone was at home, but they certainly tried and to be fair, the further along the game goes everyone sounded just fine again, so I guess it was just a few lines from everyone that got a little messed up. The acting for the new characters were perfect! Loved Zenkichi's VA's performance especially, he absolutely nailed the character and really made the banter between the Thieves lively. Sophia's...fine too, I can't really say anything about her without going into spoilers, but she did fine with her roll too. A- stuff, if only because of the few lines that could've been re-recorded to sound better and...not forcing people to record from home and just have them socially distance and record in a studio, it is what is, though.\n\nAs for the music...well...I was told not to use the default music and to just use the Persona BGM DLC I'd bought with my Deluxe Edition I got about a year ago (...yeah, this game's been on my backlog for A WHILE now...and the other DLC is kinda whatever, I used it for the beginning of the game and never used it again, so it kinda felt like a waste, I forgot to mention that in gameplay, but whatever) and while I enjoyed the DLC music being there for Persona 1-4, the other music was okay too, nothing special and it got a little repetitive hearing the same few battle songs over and over again, but there's some original music in here (namely Daredevil) which are absolutely [i] banging [/i] tunes. I'd say the overall OST excluding the DLC music is a B+, it's alright, there's some good songs in there, but [i] a lot [/i] of the music was reused from OG P5, which is a little...I guess lame.\n\n[h1] The Verdict/Conclusion [/h1]\n\nWhile this game does have its issues of being a little grindy and being a little repetitive, it's a nice companion piece to P5 that I'm sure anyone would played the original game (and also likes Muso games and or Hack N' Slashes) will enjoy. I'd give it around a 7.5-8.0/10, nothing spectacular, but a solid game that kept me invested til the end. If you've got like 70 hours to spare like I did (I idled for some of my hours to get to 93.1, don't always believe my hours, Yakuza 0 and Kiwami 1 were also botched in that regard), then go for it.\n\nOh, but here's one piece of advice [b] PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS GAME FOR FULL PRICE. WAIT FOR A SALE. [/b] Yes, I know this game's only a year old, but that doesn't excuse it for being overpriced (especially with the DLC like...really? $10 for a BGM pack, jeez man. Meanwhile, Atlus is STILL pulling this kind of stuff with Nocturne HD Remaster and more atrociously and recently with Soul Hackers 2...which I'm not gonna even bother buying until it goes on sale because 1. I still wanna play the original and 2. I don't want pay $100+ for a new game, that's just ridiculous.), it's a good game, but not $60 good, $30 maybe at most.\n\nWell, if you're still up for it despite that, then it's showtime!\n\n\n[h1] Post-Review Ramble [/h1]\n\nSo uhhh...yeah. Hoping to finish The Silver Case soon and [i] that [/i] game's gonna be a fun one to review...just you wait...",

But after playing more and more of it i got used to everything and honestly it was a great experience. Once everything makes sense to you it can be a fun experience, the story, and characters are the same if not better than in P5. Although the combat may be different its really fun and unique and is a great hash and slash game. If you like persona games, this is a nice spin to the originals. And if you like hash in slashes its also amazing to learn and feel the unique aspects. 7/10. It could have been better but im happy with what it came too.\n\nedit 1: after 100%. 9/10. it good game\n\nedit 2: after playing royal again, this game just humbles you in what to expect in other games. not a good persona game but a good game in general",

        "content": "My hours are elevated due to leaving it on when not playing. I originally played about 40 hours.  I wanted to like it...........I really did. However, there are some very \"meh\" aspects. First of which is the predictability in the flow of the game. Travel to new place, eat, find a new jail and liberate people, travel again......wash rinse and repeat. I suppose those things would be fine if they weren't each so shallow.  Each new area/place requires an investigation phase. This would simply mean talking to a few npcs..........and boom! Investigation is complete. The eating phase is simply the characters raving for about 2-3 minutes about what foods to eat in the area. This means nothing to you, the player, or to the story. It's done by cut-scenes. Ultimately it feels like a lot of the dialogue during this phase is just rehashed over and over. One character is excited about a certain food, and other characters mention alternatives.  The next issue is...............\n\nThe predictability of the issues surrounding the monarchs. Several of the monarchs have ties to members of your party, but it's not done in an interesting way. What's more, it follows the unfortunate pattern in anime-like games where it feels like every character has to say their \"piece\" regarding to a situation, and it's really not necessary........especially when they are just agreeing with each other in different words. \n\nThe gameplay is simplistic and while it may seem really cool about creating and improving new personas..........you will eventually start to lose enthusiasm despite multiple new personas being available at each level. Why? Because you will notice that the move-sets are the same as other personas and that the stats really don't vary that much when within 10 levels of each other. \n\nThe leveling is broken when you can earn as much experiance and more money in the beginning area of the 2nd jail than you can by the time you  can enter the 5th jail. The beginning area of the 2nd jail is one of the few areas where enemies respawn (including a near-500 exp enemy). Just continue to let yourself get detected and maintain it around the 30%-90% and go after the crystal enemy each time you hear it on the map.  The crystal enemy also gives about 500 exp. You can get up to a million yen in about an hour and level up quicker than most areas. \n\nUltimately, after the 4th jail and seeing everything start to repeat again on the 5th location/jail.........I just gave up and youtube-ed the ending.  Save your money. At least with Persona 5 there was a better overall story and had a dating aspect.",

        "content": "P5S is a good Hack-and-Slash that can be enjoyed by any players, be it existing Persona fans or new players.\n\nP5S is a direct continuation from the base game, Persona 5, but can be enjoyed even without experiencing the base game itself. This allows Persona fans to enjoy the story continuing from its original ending, but also allow for new players, experiencing the Persona series for the first time, to enjoy the game. The story isn't anything too great but is good enough for an enjoyable experience. The story is very linear, meaning the choices made by your character will have no impact towards the endings. The dialogue options only affects how the other characters will respond and could make for some funny interactions between characters. The character interactions are great and provides lots of humorous and some badass moments.\n\nThe gameplay is where it truly deviates from the usual Persona Series. All previous installations of the Persona franchise (Not including spinoffs like Arena or the Dancing games) were mainly Turn-Based JRPG, but P5S is a Hack and Slash. \nThis makes the game more fast-paced and action packed but could be a turn off for those who enjoy the strategy of Persona games. \n\nP5S is also significantly shorter as compared to the other Persona games. It took me 40+ hrs to clear the base game and could easily be cleared in a shorter amount of time as I took the time to do every requests and search every nook and cranny of each jail. Also there is still New Game+ to play which could easily take me an additional 20hrs or so. Making the total game time to be around 50-60hrs.\n\nOverall, I would give this game a solid 7/10. Gameplay is good but certain parts felt repetitive (especially farming Persona Points to fuse certain Personas in the later part of the game). Story was pretty so-so but the character interactions were great. I would recommend buying this game on a sale for anyone who enjoys Hack-and-Slash or are Persona Fans.\n\nEDIT: Took me an additional 25hrs to complete all achievements. Have yet to complete NG+ playthrough, but doubt I would finish it. It is still a fun game to me but to 100% it did not feel as fun as just completing the game on the first run. It lacked the replayability that all base Persona games have but the challenge that Merciless posed in the early stages of NG+ was indeed quite challenging. However, once you fused a few max stats Personas, the game becomes quite a breeze and just knowing how to use Status Ailments and Technical to your advantage to wipe through most bosses relatively easily. This does not change my rating of it as to 100% a game is more of a perfectionist or if the game is really one of your favorites. In my case, its just that I really enjoy the Persona series and just wanted to 100% it as I wait for other Persona ports that.",

Would recommend playing the original Persona 5, but not required to figure out the story, though you miss out on them all meeting and their bonding, so highly recommended.  I think it's time for Atlus to port Persona 5 Royal to PC.  (Oh, you don't need to play Royal version to enjoy this, as none of the Royal version's changes are cannon to this game.)",

Using Mosou mode with persona skills is special. Risky mode is quite challenging. I don't suppose it ended the story in emotional way. Maybe i'm really get into the game so i moved to tears while the ending. Really enjoy this game.",

It is still a hell of a lot of fun though. The combat against mobs can get old but the boss fights (of which there are plenty) are where the combat really shines and shows how excellent it is.\n\nThe story is a sequel to P5R and while the main narrative isn't nearly as engaging as the previous game's story (though still fun), the characters, both returning and new are just as excellent as always. They are what make the Persona 5 games so memorable and fun and they really shine here - P5R was their origin story and P5S is them getting to go on a new adventure already knowing each other. \n\nAnd that MUSIC...this soundtrack is amazing yall. Hard to not wanna punch something in the face when Daredevil starts playing.\n\nI will be saving my remaining side content (which is mostly just extra boss battles and finishing the persona registry) for a NG+ run down the road, but I am eager to return to this game sometime. \n",

This is sequel to the original, faithful in every way EXCEPT that it has a completely different mode of gameplay. It resembles Musou's, if you've played Dynasty Warriors OR Hyrule Warriors, you should know pretty quickly what you're getting into. I'm not a Fighting game man but you're gonna have to remember some button inputs.\n\nShould edit this as I go on. Initial impressions are good, except what in the hell are these keyboard bindings. The main character and Makoto are the only ones without free aiming, just why!?! If you're gonna play this with keyboard and mouse, I think an extra button or two on your mouse will help you out. if you have good reflexes, get the Level 1 Avenger skill (Not available initially), with which you can nullify an attack if you Phanton Dash towards that enemy at the perfect time; I tell you this as it brought me the most joy out of the combat in the game.\n\nI suffer slowdowns after a few battles, and had to reset the game. Later I found out it's caused by the Rendering Scale option. You also have to tab out of the game and come back for the slowdowns to go off or for the Rendering Scale option to apply. I change back to 1.3 Scale if I know there won't be battles for a while so it doesn't look so jagged (You cannot change this option in the middle of battle so don't plan to do it in the middle of the dungeon's boss fight before an hour of unpausable story!)\n\nAtlus, if you're not going to port the original Persona 5 OR Royal (The extended version) just yet, at the very least make your other releases up to par (Tip: Don't look up anything about the game if you wanna avoid spoilers, seriously, Youtube reviews should suffice, avoid comments or even Community Hub content).\n\nYou might want this mod, the letterbox border is just terrible, it looks like a bug: https://gamebanana.com/mods/288445",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers overall does a fantastic job of bringing P5's characters and gameplay to a whole new style of combat.  Fights are smooth, the combos are satisfying, and it still feels like Persona combat.  Elemental affinities are still present, and Joker can freely swap between available Personas.  Every playable character feels unique and has a moveset I feel accurately represents them.  For example, Morgana can transform into his car form seen in Mementos, and several of Makoto's combos involve riding Johanna or rapid punches.  The story overall was pretty good and helped make this still feel like a Persona game.  The Phantom Thieves are rather static characters compared to the original game, but instead they help others find their own way, especially the two new members of the Thieves.  However the first few Jails can feel rather...samey and formulaic.  It doesn't help that every boss fight takes place in a castle.  It loses some of the uniqueness seen in P5's Palaces.  I also don't think the Jail Monarchs have the same impact as Palace rulers, but there were good ones.  \n\nOne major returning part of the game to really tie it back to the Persona series is the Velvet Room.  Lavenza alone manages it this time as Igor is nowhere to be seen.  And this was honestly what I felt to be the weakest part of the game.  Especially coming nearly fresh off of Persona 5 Royal, the Velvet Room felt very bare bones.  Persona Fusion works in pretty much the same way, but there's not much else.  You gain the ability to level your Personas directly up to Joker's current level with a new currency, but it gets very expensive very quickly.  Not helped are the new restrictions that the Personas themselves now must be at a certain level to be fused.  This wasn't a big deal in the early game, but trying to get powerful Personas in the late game was a chore as they often required Personas acquired in early Jails to be at a level far past when they stop learning new skills.  For example, King Frost requires Jack Frost and Jack-o-Lantern to be at level 40 while Joker to be at level 66.  But Jack-o-Lantern might be around level 8.  So the only way to get him the extra levels is to spend the new persona points.  But I at least could not find a reliable way of getting them besides re-summoning and dismissing high level Personas.  Gaining new Personas in the field is random; there is a chance a defeated Shadow will drop a mask for Joker, and that chance can be increased by leveling a skill.  Repeated Personas will give persona points instead of exp like in P5.\n\nOverall this is still a very fun game with fantastic music and a decent story, but I think Persona 5 Royal is the more polished experience.  But for a spin-off sequel in a totally different genre?  It did a great job.\n\nOne last note: the digital deluxe edition is slightly misleading.  The art gallery and OST are locked in a separate application with no built-in way to download the contents.",

But, it fits the visual style of the predecessor Persona 5 perfectly. Also, playing P5 first is recommended, it contains the entire main cast and follows after the events of P5. Multiple story references to P5 too\n\nMusic and Visuals are A+ like you're used to\nFusion system like in the Persona series, but with roughly half as many Personas and skills.\nPlayable characters have different combat styles: buffing, fast/slow, status effects, etc.\nStory is similar to P5, writing quality is on par with most fanfiction. But, 90% voiced with great voice acting! Also in Japanese with English subtitles.\n\nMust buy for SMT fans. Also recommended for fans of Nier/DMC action games. If you're neither, check out some gameplay footage!",

        "content": "Let me get this out of the way - I am a HUGE Persona fan. I finished Persona 5 (2 times), Persona 4, I've played Dancing in the past, and I'm currently playing Q and 3.\n\nI CANNOT recommend this game. I am not a fan of Dynasty Warrior themed games. However, the problem goes beyond that. I didn't feel any... heart and soul in this spinoff. It just feels empty. I love the cities, they're beautifully designed and animated but... The dialogue isn't getting with me. It feels like dialogue that was created by an AI just for the sake of rushing out a half-baked story. The heroes don't feel like they're emotionally tied to the villains like they were in Persona 5, and beyond that? The villains just simply aren't interesting to begin with. It feels like they were just thrown into the mix for the sake of combat instead of them having a place in the story.\n\nThe perfect description for this game is generic. It's just not good, in my opinion. I found myself skipping through dialogue, and even skipping cutscenes. Cutscenes! I've never skipped anything in a Persona game prior to this game! A single sentence can easily sum up what was drug out through pages upon pages of generic, filler-like dialogue. And speaking of being drug out, I feel like this whole game is drug out through and through. As I got closer to the end of the game, I found myself wanting more and more for it to be over, groaning as I discovered 2 extra jails past what I believed to be the final boss.\n\nI will say this - this is the most advanced Dynasty Warrior themed game out there. And with that being said... It still manages to be a boring, repetitive slog in terms of gameplay. The combat is just X, with a few Y's thrown into the mix for a petty amount of combos you can do. The combat, in reality, just becomes spamming whatever ~Ma move hits everybody's weakness.\n\nToday, I'm gonna FORCE myself to finish this game, just for the sake of uninstalling it to free up space on my computer. Yeah, you heard that right, force. You should NEVER have to force yourself to finish a game, it means it just straight up isn't a fun/good game. It just feels like such a slog... As a person who literally completed New Game and New Game + of P5R back to back with no break, I'm heavily disappointed with this spinoff - and if I could... honestly? I'd refund it. I hope the next spinoff will be better.\n\nEdit: I was so bored playing this that ultimately \"forcing myself to play it today\" turned into forcing myself to play it spread out through a period of a few days. It's that boring to me.",

One being that the side mission requests can get very repetitive and boring especially at the end as you do the same things over and over again and get a ton of them especially near the end of the game. Also on hard difficulty, which is what I played the whole game on, some boss enemies get insanely bullet spongey as you wail on them for what seems like forever without much risk of dying. I also have a minor complaint in that the all out attacks seemed pointless at times as you would break the enemies guard only to deal an insanely small amount of damage after using what is supposed to be a finisher. I understand that it shouldn't just instant kill bosses, but sometimes I would use it and the boss health bar wouldn't even visibly move. In terms of positives there are countless including the near perfect transition from turn based to action combat as well as the excellent aesthetics and a story that tugged on my heart strings a couple of times.",

It's enjoyable to see the Phantom Thieves together again, joyfully hanging out one moment and deep in action dungeon-crawling the next. The gameplay is a drastic shift from turn-based Persona 5, but Koei Tecmo managed to revise their mindless hack-and-slash recipe from the Musou franchise to incorporate personas, the element and skill system into the action very well. It feels like I'm playing a normal Persona game, only with the real time action gameplay instead.

WTF ATLAS? IT IS A SINGLE PLAYER GAME YOU ASSHOLES! you can tell by the graphs that 99% of the reviews were made the day the game was released which means 99% didnt even play the game before making reviews. steam reviews is like a mafia. you only have a voice if you pay in and mob mentality rules. fuck you steam, FUCK YOU ATLAS AND FUCK YOU DENUVO!",

        "content": "TL:DR\nGameplay? Very Good\nSoundtrack? It's a banger \ud83e\udd18\nArtstyle / Graphics? Beautiful\nStory? Good\n-----------------------------------------\n\nA sequel to Persona 5 - The gameplay changes from the usual turn based combat that you can find in all Persona games to a hack-and-slash type combat you can find in games such as in the Dynasty Warrior series. While it does change the gameplay, the gameplay is very good, especially in Persona 5's artstyle. Gameplay is very good.\n\nSoundtrack can be described with one word: Amazing. The songs you'll usually hear in this game are remixes of songs you'll find in the original Persona 5, but do not get me wrong, THEY ARE NOT BAD! The remixes are just as good as the original songs they are remixed from. You'll enjoy the battle themes, boss themes, etc. The original songs made for this game though are good, while continuing to retain the Persona 5 OST's original style.\n\nThe artstyle is still the same as it was from Persona 5, and it looks gorgeous. As I said from earlier, the combat looks SO fantastic due to Persona 5's artstyle, making everything look flashy and just all around beautiful. Though, I can say it may be overwhelming for a small amount of people, but it wasn't for me.\n\nThe story isn't necessarily the best or what you expect from a Persona game, but it is a good sequel to Persona 5 story-wise. The story does take place a few months after the end of the original Persona 5, and it ends with a satisfying conclusion. For those who hasn't played Persona 5 originally, I wouldn't really recommend playing this game at first, as there may be things you don't understand, or things you would appreciate more if you played through the original Persona 5, such as the characters. That's to say though, the developers for this game did say you can enjoy the game even if you didn't play the original Persona 5, so knock yourself out. Overall though, story's great.\n\nThanks for reading.",

        "content": "It was probably wrong to jump into this game as my first Persona game in terms of story, (second JRPG I've ever touched) but I found that I was able to somewhat pick up things fairly quickly from wherever it was left off from whichever the last game was. As someone who is brand new to the Persona franchise, this game was a blast to play, and the story while I thought it wasn't something that was 'out there' and a 10/10, the music is incredible, and bond that the cast of characters share and their interactions with each other, really kept me playing.\n\nAll of the characters are likeable in their own ways, and while the dialogue does get a tad corny every now and then, it's just a bunch of people who are just having a great time on their Summer road trip. What's not to like about it? Sometimes it does get a bit old with the same repeated lines when you're exploring the Jails, but other than that, the cast ranging from the 'problem student' Ryuji, to the dad of the group and cop Zenkichi, hell even Ichinose, even when she doesn't get as much screen time, they are all great.\n\nThe story was pretty decent, while I won't spoil anything here, the character development of some of the cast, was super satisfying. Although, the plot twist or two while it did have an impact, I did see them coming from a mile away. Overall, the story is still definitely memorable, and something that Hardcore Persona fans and brand new players like me would have a great time with.\n\nThe combat is fast and frantic. The gameplay is slick and some of the animations are super cool. Of course, each character has their strengths and weaknesses, while the game obviously isn't just going to let you go through the story like a breeze, if you don't play with these strengths and weaknesses in mind, even on normal difficulty which is what I played at, you will be punished more than you think you will, and I like that challenge. I do recommend that you play on hard difficulty however, and I probably should've done so from the beginning, because one you get your all your Personas kitted out with a wide range of abilities, buffs and debuffs, hitting those weaknesses really does a number on enemies and makes some sections a bit too easy. \n\nThe soundtrack is absolute banger, which is a bit of a shame, since some of the best tracks are behind the combat encounters, and like I pointed out just then, the fights can be very quick. When you do get to those longer encounters, the music, combined with the slick gameplay is bliss.\n\nIf you already are a fan of the franchise, I can probably see you buying this game full price upfront. But if you're like me who was debating whether to do the same or not, I'd still recommend a buy, but when this game does get a discount, I would highly recommend that you buy it immediately. The art direction of the game is top notch, the gameplay is excellent, the story definitely has its moments, and the cast of characters is awesome. If the previous Persona games would now get a PC port, even with its difference in gameplay, I would throw money at you ATLUS and SEGA.\n\nZenkichi best boomer/10",

I enjoyed meeting all the characters again and seeing where they left off. That's about it. All this game does for me is make me want to play the original game. I really wanted to like this game, but i couldn't bring myself to really truly enjoy it. Which is a shame cause I really love this franchise. If you do decide to give it a go, do yourself a favor and use controller. The keyboard controls are horrendous, genuinely a thing of nightmares. Overall: 4/10 \n\nNot really my cup of tea ;n;",

        "content": "I was a bit disappointed at first because I was expecting a Warriors game. Instead of a strategical beat em up, I got Persona game with real time combat. The jails don't feel like Warriors battlefields, they feel like dungeons. Not saying that's inherently bad, just wasn't what I was expecting. The writing isn't amazing, in fact they somehow managed to make the characters feel even more one note than they did in the first game. But persona spin offs are always like that, let's be real all of us were going into this expecting that. If I could give this a neutral rating I would. Overall I'd say it's good but probably worth waiting for it to go on sale. I don't think it's worth a full 60 bucks.",

        "content": "Probably one of the most fun Persona experiences thus far. I got into the Persona series very late as I only started when Persona 5 first came out. I love this series, the game play feels fun and refreshing compared to some other turn based RPGs I have played in the past, the social links help you build a really big emotional attachment to the characters in the game, and even the story in amazing. Now about Strikers, it takes all of that and simplifies some aspects but makes others lots of fun. Strikers still has an amazing and compelling story just like Persona 5 and 4... is it predictable, a little bit, BUT I think that is okay as the story is really just there to have a base for the AMAZING game play that Strikers has. If you always wanted to try a Persona game but could never get into because you thought there was too much out of combat time the boy do I recommend this game.",

Action based combat takes a bit of getting used to but the first \"jail\" is a great introduction to the new combat system. The more you progress in the story the more you are wanting from the story and characters. If you loved Persona for the rich story and character interactions, this is a game that you must pick up and play for yourself!",

        "content": "I've got this game imported from Japan after a month it came out in Japan. So around March of 2020, both on Nintendo Switch and Playstation 4. Beat them both which was nice, if you are expecting similar gameplay to Persona 5 or Royal then you are mistaken, this game has similar gameplay as Hyrule Warriors(That's the first game that popped in my head) As a spinoff (I know some people consider this game as a sequel but I don't really) Scramble, I won't be mentioning it as \"Strikers\", I'll be mentioning it as Scramble since it was called that in Japan. If you think you gonna see characters from Royal in this game, I'm sorry to say but they aren't in it. The story in this game is somewhat alright, I do like in some aspects and some I don't but I won't mention anything due to spoilers and I don't want to spoil anything. The gameplay is pretty alright kinda just stiffy imo, but once you get used to it, you can play it. One thing I would like to complain about is the fusion system, it's feels off like extremely but I think it's just me. Overall I give this game a 7.5/10, it's good for a spinoff but compare to the other Persona spinoffs. It isn't that good in some degree, the only thing I do like is the animation and the story.",

Slasher with Persona 5 characters feels really good, Building personas mechanic is fun. Music from atlus as always amazing and the way the game looks.... I love it 8.5/10",

        "content": "persona 5 royal is my favorite game of all time. i even cried when i beat it, absolutely incredible. this abomination of a game is a waste of money and if i had to force myself to beat it: following reasons\n\nthe gameplay is incredibly unfun, the \"jails\" (which is a glorified name for palaces in p5) are unbelievably repetitive, have no flavor, and are reskins of the current city you are in (which is not impressive looking either). the fun part of palaces other than the scenery was that you could do puzzles and explore around. in this game, neither of those exist as everything is a copy and paste of each other and there is 0 fun interaction whatsoever.\n\nthe combat is super SUPER horrible. i really enjoy hard games. i loved dark souls 3 and i have beaten every kingdom hearts game on lvl 1 critical. challenge is NOT an issue. unfortunately, this games combat is lackluster at best but the issue is that there is a fight LITERALLY (i promise i am not exaggerating) every 5 seconds (sometimes less) of walking in this game. if you don't fight youll get behind on levels,  so it's all around bad. not only this, the \"difficulty\" is not actual difficulty, it's just numbers being changed, the attacks aren't any harder to dodge or have any different logic like a harder mode would in another game, it's literally just more health and you deal less damage. this was so horrible and unfun that once i got to the third dungeon i modified the game to one shot every enemy and ignore all damage just so i could get through the game without ripping my hair out from boredom\n\nif you've played and enjoyed a persona game, you KNOW the stories are absolutely amazing. if you would like to avoid spoilers for persona 3 fes, golden, or royal, or this game itself, skip to the next paragraph. persona 5 royal has one of the best stories i've ever seen, be it a book, a video game, or a movie. the characters were great. in this game you have a copy and paste of shido and a character that has a background like akechi's and has the personality of sojiro, all of the antagonists in the game are just rehashed and watered down versions from the previous game. remember kamoshida? the first palace in this game is a girl that takes advantage of men, the second dungeon is a guy who sells writing that isn't actually his... the third dungeon is a cross of okumura and a crappy shido, the fourth is the only actual interesting dungeon that i won't spoil anything for, the fifth has nothing to mention, but the sixth dungeon's antagonist is just a copy and paste of shido and the next one after that is basically mementos and ending the world all over again. nothing in this game is original whatsoever. one of the characters, sophia, is a copy and paste of aigis from persona 3. the only character in this game that i actually liked was the final antagonist, ichinose kuon, had a good personality and ok motive, which is the only reason i liked her, but it was literally just akechi 2.0 and you also could easily tell she would be the antagonist immediately after speaking to her from the first time. the way she was revealed as the antagonist isn't good either. in royal or golden for example you are interacting with the antagonist the whole time and tension is built and you later realize they've been betraying you the whole time, in this game, it's just \"oh, remember kuon from way back when? yeah shes behind this\" it's so unbelievably stupid. also, the final enemy of the game is, \"phones took over everyones lives and we can't think for ourselves now\" literally the dumbest story ever\n\nthe design/look of the game is the only thing i can credit the game on, outside of the dungeons, the game looks absolutely great, despite being terrible in the dungeons. not much to say here\n\nthe music was another strong point. in the persona games. the persona games are the only games i know where the music in them can be good enough to put in playlists with \"real music\", in this game, all of the original songs made specifically for this game are absolute bangers. the only complaint is that any song that received a \"remix\" for scramble that was taken from 5 absolutely sucks in this, because they tried to turn a jazzy thing into rock, and it absolutely sucks.\n\nthe only reason i forced myself to play through this is because i've beaten every persona game and i had to force myself to play this to say i'm fully up with the story in every game and i also spent 70 dollars on it sooooooo\n\nyea don't buy this game",

        "content": "This is an easy recommendation for me. The story can sometimes drag and feel like it's progressing nowhere. At times, the gameplay can feel a little clunky and disjointed. However, ultimately I think these more minor issues can be overlooked in the grand scheme of the game. It was nice to see these characters brought back for another (much shorter) story. \nGetting past these moments where the story can drag is relatively easy, but the gameplay is harder to write off. In my eyes, the original Persona 5 practically perfected JRPG combat, but the Action RPG gameplay on display here is just serviceable. I eventually got used to pausing the action to use persona abilities, but I feel like getting used to this overall hindered my experience with the game. I didn't really have a problem with it, but it's worth noting that this game lacks a confidant system entirely, and the days progress as the story progresses.\nWhile maybe not being quite as good as the original game\u2019s, the soundtrack is very well done. All of the new tracks were really memorable, and remixes of old tracks were too. The opening was great as well.\nThe story starts strong, drags on for a little while, then picks right back up as it climaxes. I think the payoff and experience are well worth putting up with these moments where the story drags. This road trip structure was really enjoyable and held the game together when the story was lacking. If you enjoyed these characters in Persona 5 and thought it\u2019d be fun to go on a road trip with them, then look no further.\n",

P5S is pretty good, a little lacking in story and villain development with sometimes clunky controls.\n\nThis game is basically Atlus's experiment at doing an ARPG, it turned out 'okay'. Camera and lock targeting is pretty lack luster. You have to 'pause' a lot with persona/gun to just get an understanding of what is going on and switching between characters is a little clunky for an modern ARPG. On top of that, the battles are 'instanced' so you lose a little of the open-world-esque that you would expect from an ARPG.\n\nThough you have a calendar like past Personas, the game is a little more free form with the player choices. I actually found the lack of the 'confidant' aspect of character development made it feel pretty empty. Especially since the characters became pretty well developed in P5/P5R and almost none occurred in P5S.",

        "content": "This recommendation comes with some degree of caveat. For those of you looking for a Dynasty Warriors type of game, be prepared for system mechanics that are very unusual to the genre and not super intuitive unless you've played the main branch of Persona games already. For those looking for something similar to the main branch of Persona games, you'll only find bits and pieces of that here, as the gameplay is based around high-speed action rather than turn-based strategy, and things such as Social Links/Confidants and an approach to a day-to-day calender system are not present here. There is still a calender system in this game, but it's much less pronounced since you aren't limited in how much you can do in a single day, and thus there's never really a threat of running out of time.\n\nIf these are things you can work around or if you simply have exposure to both the genre and the Persona series, you'll find a very fun game that manages to combine the systems from both games pretty well. Overall score would be an 8/10 if I had to give it a numerical value.",

It's half as long, the story is half as ambitious, and the gameplay systems are half as detailed compared to persona 5. This game is far more focused on combat and action in general compared to persona 5. There is no confidant system in p5s for example. Overall, I'll give it a 7.5/10. Only recommended to P5 fans.

        "content": "The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.\n\nStrategy\n\nHis fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.\n\nThe Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.\n\nA Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.\n\nThe Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.\n\nHowever, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.\n\nAgainst non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.\n\nIt is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.\n\nIn a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.\n\nLong-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.\n\nWhen there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.\n\nPassive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.\n\nDefensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.\n\nIf the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.\n\nFor Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.\n\nFor Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.\n\nThey can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider\u2019s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.\n\nThe Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.\n\nA Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted\n\nA very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.\n\nThis can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.\n\nThe Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.\n\nA Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower.",

Exploit weaknesses, All-Out-Attack, Baton Pass.[b] THEY ARE ALL STILL THERE! [/b] I'm surprise of how they are manage to do that and make it work flawlessly. And the most exciting of all, the Showtime is just gorgeous!\n\n[h1] Everyday Mechanics [/h1]\nApart from the cut confidant, not a lot have change. You start by gather the information about the target  and then you go in the dungeon now call \"The Jail\" and then you go to a total nut job mode. Sometime do a request and spend time talking with teammates or inside the RV. Basically the game loop is that.\nBond system is the new one that they introduce in this game. Similar to Social Links/Confidant but instead of going to each teammates and get their abilities, you get points to upgrades which you will need them.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nSince currently at the time of this review I have not finish the game yet and I know that no ones want a spoiler. So the only thing that I'm going to talking about is how they tell the story.\nThe story goes on like in the Persona 5, you notice that something is going on in Shibuya just when the Thieves are having a summer trip and later they know that the issue is going across the japan in various cities. The story has to deal with trauma of \"the Monarch\", the ruler of Jail, that works like a Palace [b]with a twist[/b].\n\n[h1] Sound and Music [/h1]\nTalk about Persona without the music is [b]WRONG[/b].\nAlthough Shoji Meguro, ATLUS house composer, is not the composer in Persona 5 Striker, the music still an absolute banger! Sound effects overall is perfect.\nRight now I really dig \"Welcome To The Jail\", \"Counter Strike\", \"Axe To Grind\", \"You are Stronger\" and a lot more!\n\nTo be honest, the things that ATLUS did. This would be a bottom at my list of what ATLUS would do the their games and I have doubt at first about this being the Beat'em Up kind of game because I don't like this kind of game. But they really take my breath away here, got to give it to them.\n\n[h1]Some After Thought[/h1]\nWhat I said above is all true, this game is still a fantastic game and I urge anyone who interested in this game to play. HOWEVER, this game-by all means-still is not a traditional Persona experience. I still recommend mainline Persona more than this game overall. And since this is a beat 'em up game and this is a linear-story game, the replay-ability is next to none apart from the completionist gamer. So for me, the flaws of this game is really \"It's not normal Persona\" which is dumb. ATLUS did a thing that throw us off, and they done a fantastic job. The bitter opening of this paragraph will not effect my verdict.\n\nThis. is. still. fantastic.",

That being said, SAVE OFTEN.\nSP/persona skills seem unbalanced, especially on Merciless mode; you have to use skills multiple times to break \"shields\" on bosses, let alone down them for an all out attack, but the amount of SP each character has is similar to P5/P5R, where this is not the case. Endgame often turns into a case of spamming persona attacks and SP items (the grind for SP items is real, especially since shops don't restock unless you do multiple battles in the metaverse)\nSome controls are a little wonky (such as all-out attack, phantom dash, follow-up attack, interact, etc. all being triggered by the same button, with limited ability to create separate hotkeys for them). This seems to be a symptom of poor porting from console.\n\nYMMV (i.e. some info that may be a pro or a con depending on the person):\n\nNo confidants/social links, no time management (you can leave and re-enter the dungeons at any time to replenish HP and SP with no detriment), no turn-based combat (i.e. missing many Persona gameplay staples)\nThis is a direct sequel to P5, NOT P5R (and the story very much reflects this)",

I just hope I can still get like 60 hours or more on this title because that's the amount of time you spend on games you love.  \n\nSo far it looks like a much better version than 4.  Thank you.",

The dungeons feel more fun since you can actually walk around them quickly and actually DO them. The combat is insanely fun. Zenkichi and Sophia are amazingly written characters that solo Kasumi and Akechi, tenfold. Their characterisation being well-woven into the story is also amazing. The pacing is much better than Persona 5 being around 50 hours playtime instead of 100. \n\nIf you haven't played this game, DO IT. It is amazing. It is emotional. It is powerful. Everything is just better Persona 5 and you don't even need to play Persona 5 to understand the story or characters.",

        "content": "It's very weird to see an entire full-length sequel to Persona 5 with Dynasty Warriors-style action combat, but it's a really cool idea and it's surprisingly well-done! While this game's menu animations aren't quite as immaculate as the original game's, they did a fantastic job carrying over the look of Persona 5 into this engine, to the point where a lot of the time it literally just looks like more of P5, but now running in 60fps. Per Persona tradition, the OST is still absolutely amazing, even in what is essentially a spin-off, and with that classic Warriors-style buttrock flavor appropriately mixed in as well.\n\nThe combat is very interesting at first. While attack combos and switching between characters feels a lot like other recent Warriors games, it still has a LOT of mechanics from P5. Sneaking up on enemies, going in and out of battle encounters, Persona skills, elemental weaknesses, all-out attacks, managing your HP and SP with items, even a lite Confidant system is here. However, much like Warriors games, you are often fighting a LOT of enemies at once, and nothing seems to stop all of them from attacking you at once, with all sorts of different abilities. This makes the combat VERY overwhelming for me, to the point where I definitely prefer Persona games' usual turn-based combat.\n\nAs someone who wasn't particularly impressed by the story and characters in Persona 5, it's kind of hard to get into this game for those same aspects, especially since a lot of it feels like a retread of the original game's plot points anyway. I almost dropped this game entirely since the story is pretty samey in the first few dungeons. Still, if you really like the cast of Persona 5, then you might have a great time with this game.",

Musou games get really fun once you get the hang of it and all the characters all have unique traits(except Morgana getting a fucking weak 1 damage battering ram move. Not cool Atlus.) and once it gets on a roll, the gameplay gets addicting. First off, the first jail is seriously a chore to get through and it may make it seem like there is nothing else to do. But they made the decision to bar all the side studff until you can get to your next jail.\n\nSecond off, I said it's worth it But only on a sale please. It may have a good gameplay loop but I find this to be a bit... lacking for its current normal price\n\nThird off, you may need to atleast have knowledge of PS's plot to get the story\n\nNext, the music is amazing and absolutely gets you in the mood to straight destroy\n\nThe game also has a semi open world aspect where you get to buy stuff so you can cook or get it ready for use. Also be sure to always talk to your teammates in the non-metaverse map if its a new day. They will usually harbor some loot for you.\n\nUmm... damn writing a long review is hard.",

Needs time getting used to the combat system because it's different from usual Persona games, but it's a fun challenge. Some middle jails can be a bit underwhelming, but it gets tough near the end. It's worth it.\n\nI adored the character, universe, and game so much, now I need P5 PC port so I can learn their backstory",

If you said No. Do not buy this game as it is required story wise. \n\nAfter just completing Persona 5 Royal after 140 hours and absolutely loving it for the masterpiece that it is. a True 10/10. I was looking for more and i came upon P5S. Is this game better then Persona 5 Royal? No, Not by a long shot. Is this game worth playing? Yes. The combat does take alot of time to get used to and can be at times annoying. Especially the first half of the game. The bosses tend to be HP sponges and do not be scared to lower the diff. Normal is mostly good. Do not play this game on hard unless you want to suffer. The best part of this game is spending more time with all the characters that you grew to love in Persona 5 and meeting some new ones on the way. The story is solid and there will be some rehashing, related to Royal sem 3. (sem 3 is not cannon in this game). It was nice to travel around Japan and see the different areas as well. Overall i would rate the game a 7.5/10.",

        "content": "P5S, maybe surprisingly, feels like a full and proper sequel to P5 (but, of course, not Royal..). Clocking in at about a 45 hour playthrough for me, it's a bit a good amount more lean than P5 (which took me about 110 hours), and I'm all for it. The social sim half of P5 is now condensed to a lot of screen time with your teammates (as well as building a general Bond meter to get skill points), but the fact that you and the group are ALWAYS together means you don't feel like you're being shorted on social content. The musou-style combat (combined with traditionally Persona-style dungeon exploring) works excellently and, frankly, I liked it way more than the turn-based combat of P5(R). I highly recommend it if you liked P5 and want more time hanging out with the gang.",

Same basic battle system, but here you're able to keep hitting attack in-between all your persona abilities to hit the weak spots and move around a bit. You'll still mainly be relying on hitting weaknesses and then performing all-out attacks. \n\nStory-wise, nothing groundbreaking here. It's just a road-trip romp with all the friends you made in P5 plus a new addition or two. \n\nOverall, if you wanted more adventures from the original P5, then this game is for you!",

It's repetitive/shallow enough that I'll never replay it unlike the main games and the first dungeon is a slog since you don't get the abilities that keep the pace up/add a smidge of combat depth until later but it picks up after that. In other words, worth a playthrough if you're a fan and can stomach some of the early stodginess.",

        "content": "The Gameplay (although kinda gets repetitive just pressing the same two buttons), soundtrack and characters are amazing and it's a huge improvement over the original Persona 5, but here's a couple of things that bother me as I'm still playing the game while I am writing/editing this (long??) review and i hope these could be taken notes for in the future to improve upon:\n\n1. (Issue that connects to the Modern Games)\nThe other battle songs being locked behind a DLC paywall (even though i paid for it so that the main songs wouldn't start getting on my nerves) which was the same issue i had with P5 when i played it years ago because of that.\n\n2. The Calendar doesn't do anything since there's no deadline making returning and that leads to the unecessary issue of  leaving and entering the Jails repetitive for some healing instead of giving the checkpoints some sort of healing station in the dungeons like in the older games since the calendar barely does anything like in 3-5.\n\n3. (Another big Issue that also connects to the Modern games)\nIt's been so many games and spin offs after P2: Eternal Punishment and there still isn't an option to make the Navi shut up, like Rise and Futaba because they're very annoying because their lines get repeated a lot and gets tiring especially Futaba with her very \"quirky and cool\" gaming references with her \"\"\"\"\"crippling social anxiety\"\"\"\" problem when the first Navi did her character better because she's quiet and chill (and that was over 13 years ago with Persona 3 in 2008 on the mf PS2) so i have to mute the Voices entirely during bosses and Normal Combat making the cutscenes afterwards awkward til i finally get to actually open up the menu after 10 million cutscenes bringing my next issue being..\n\n4. That i wish i wasn't bloated with cutscenes that last longer than the gameplay which completely ruins the pace during the jails when the game comes to a stop for just a cutscene of everyone standing still til i can move again, why not have them talk about it in the top right box while i move around, which is an ongoing issue that just gets tiring after the first jail but thankfully there's an option for me to skip cutscenes so I'm glad they put that lol.\n\n4.5. The Second Hot Spring Scene is self-explanatory, just not really all that funny after Persona 3 since that had a fun minigame with it.\n\n5. Why can i not move my camera as i am moving inside of a vent like in P5?\n\n6. Why can i not see my Showtime gauge/bar like how HP, SP and Ammo are shown in the UI instead of hoping to god i get a showtime to do DMG/Knock Down Midbosses that are objectivelly harder than the main bosses\n\n6.5 But it's Okay because nobody bothered to playtest Yusuke because he demolishes literally everything with his two hit combo no matter how strong the boss is to Physical\n\n7. Istg i feel like the AI in this game is how people see the AI in Persona 3 but instead this is worse than that because you don't have a tactics menu to have some control of your party so that you tell what each Party Members does to prioritize for you instead of them going headfirst dive into a modboss/boss and die out of nowhere, or even use their SP for no reason when i don't want them to which connects to my previous second issue, the main healers/support not healing Futaba when i want those character specifically to focus on support.\nIt's a real shame because i'm minding my own business in combat to then just suddenly realize two of my characters died while all of them were together and i'm out of items to revive them back and lose the fight countless times because of it.\n\n8. I don't know if it's because of the hardware I use since i own a Low End Laptop (little bit higher than the minimum requirements) o play games and play it on the lowest settings for it to run good ..but like, to my experience the game tends to softlock in the loading screen a couple of times especially when i go back in the Van so i have to press Alt + F4 to exit the game possibly losing a lot of progress that i haven't saved which is enfuriating since all the progress i made didn't matter because of this\n\nHere's the Positive that i have to say about it for my own experience:\n\nOverall my favourite parts about this game are the Combat (surprisingly after all i said), the two new characters: Sophia and Zenkichi, the Villains are sorta well better written with them having backstories instead of just being evil because they're a \"nasty\" adult and the god dang soundtrack, especially the ones in each area since to me they're overall the strongest part of this game making me not quitting or refunding it entirely, still pretty cool game i recommend a lot, not at full price because this doesn't deserve the $60 tag so get it during a sale\n\n7/10",

        "content": "tl:dr, combat's bad, story's bad, only bright spot is you get to see the P5 cast again.\n\nYeah I dunno what this \"Musou\" or \"Dynasty Warriors\" thing sparks in people, but it really does not mesh well with Persona's style. When you do an All-out attack or the screen says \"Shows over\" it's supposed to signify telling the enemy \"smell ya later\" in a flashy end to the fight. But here it takes maybe a centimeter off some midboss' interminable health bar? The best thing this game's combat does is make you appreciate how well designed the original P5's combat is. Not many people look or feel good frantically button-mashing into a huge dude. It's just awful; it's awkward, it's long, it's painful, it tests reflexes that you didn't need in P5, and you have to do way more of it than you did before because this is a much more fighty game.\n\nCan't speak for later antagonists, but at least the first one is a complete writeoff. One of the things Persona games do brilliantly is encode a larger theme into the motivation for each foe. P5 is centered around rebellion, so that every boss feels almost cathartic to beat. P5S has, at least so far, just been \"let's beat this person up because they're bad and we're good\". There's no theme to this, and it makes the story feel way less fulfilling. The only thing I'm still here for is more of the main cast, and even then there are no bonding events so the interaction is superficial at best.",

Although AI in this game is already some of the better ones that I've seen, your teammates can still act like buffoons and get killed constantly by easily dodgeable attacks.\n\noverall great game. The highlight of this game for me is gameplay, dungeon exploration and fight management (and music of course). Don't expect a great story and you'll enjoy this game a lot.\n",

        "content": "I'm not exactly the most professional person to give my opinion obviously, and especially not someone who's played a ton of Persona outside 5 and it's spin-offs. But I'd say that this was an extremely fun experience. The story isn't all that complex or thought provoking and can be a tad generic, or even rehashed from the original at times. But every area has a good message and consistently interesting dialogue between the party members. Like the original, the cast is great. And the two new additions to the crew are very much welcome. Then combat, much like the story, is pretty simple. Many of the mechanics are the same as far as weaknesses, and how buffs affect you and the enemy go. However this time it's put in an entirely different system. Ditching the turn based combat of the Persona series and making it a stylized and unique version of the Dynasty Warriors format. And with that in mind I can concede that it isn't for everyone. But in my personal opinion, the combat is fun, fast paced, and certain battles can genuinely feel grand. Notably the various boss fights. All the animations are very good and stay true to the style. Each character has their own personal tech and that gives them even more diversity than just simply different elements and basic attacks. All the showtime attacks look great as expected, and all out attacks are just as satisfying. I don't even NEED to get started on the music. Every track is just so amazing, and best of all you never have to hear the same track over and over since every battle is randomized. All the remixes are fantastic, and a personal favourite of mine is counterstrike. But on that note, I'll complete this miniature review. I'm yet to play New Game Plus, as I am writing this almost immediately after completing the main story. But I can only assume it'll add some bonus content that add a little more spice into a second playthrough. Thank you for reading, and I hope if you buy this game you enjoy it as much as I.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is the summer vacation I never had. It functions as both a spin-off of a spin-off and a direct sequel to Persona 5. Therefore, I would highly recommend playing Persona 5 before diving into Strikers. Also, be sure to bring your PS4 controller for this one, as I felt the frantic combat feels significantly better on a controller.\n\nSpeaking of combat, it amazes me how well the flair and strategy of Persona combat mixes with the frantic, visually-busy Musou combat. The only other Musou game I've played is Hyrule warriors, yet I enjoyed the combat in this game much more. In fact,  it feels more like the combat in FFVII Remake. Button-mashing won't get you far; I had to turn down the difficulty to Easy until I was acclimated with the combat mechanics. Each character and Persona has their own combos, elemental affinities, and spells. Nothing makes me feel more like a badass than mowing down an army of Shadows with the power of friendship and the manifestations of your inner rebel. \n\nMoving on to the story, it parallels much of the narrative drawn in the original Persona 5. Without going into details, I will say that the first couple Jails serve to introduce you to the mechanics and lore of Jails. The monarchs of said jails are just one-and-done antagonists whose hearts you change. After this, the way the story ramps up parallels Persona 5 rather closely. It should be noted that the story is shorter (with regards to Persona standards). However, this is not an issue and I felt the pacing was actually well-done.\n\nMusic in the Persona series is nothing short of exceptional, and Strikers is no different. I did not think it was possible that \"Rivers in the Desert\" or \"Blooming Villain\" could be made any more epic than they already are. Later, you can even customize which songs play during battle.\n\nThe voice acting is stellar, including those of the new characters. Sophia is such sweetheart; her character growth is well written. As for Zenkichi, his character arc draws parallels to Dojima from P4. He and Sophia fit right into the Persona universe, unlike Lana in Hyrule Warriors, who seemed out-of-place.\n\nWith the amount of action going on, the game never dipped in framerate or crashed. One of my favorite changes involves NG+. You get all the characters and equipment from your first playthrough, unlike in P5 where you were limited to certain characters because of the story. It allows for ample time to customize and deck out all the Phantom Thieves with the best gear and moves. \n\nOverall, there is not much I disliked about the game. The damage sponginess of some of the bosses on the harder difficulties is a bit exasperating (and don't get me started on Merciless...). Nevertheless,  this is definitely worth a purchase if you liked Persona 5.",

        "content": "This game really is a sequel to the Vanilla P5, with two great new characters, development for the ones that need it (Specially Psycho-Fluff girl Haru). and a great OST that replicates the style of the original.\n\nAlthough considered a warriors game; it really translates the SMT/Persona mechanics, making the game feel more distinct than just another button masher.\n\nPlaying this on hard is the best experience because you can have the fun of ravaging through hordes of enemies while also keeping check of every stat, weakness and strength so that you don't get your ass handed to you instantly by a strong or even \"weak\" enemies (If you know, you know)\n\nBest of both worlds; Stfu about P5R on PC pls.",

It felt like going on a vacation with old friends. The dads in these games are always the best characters, no cap. 9/10, Even though it's a Persona game and frankly this should be par for the course, it was surprisingly lengthy.\n\nedit 1: the game sometimes dropped frames near the end but it was nothing awful.\n\nedit 2: i wish i got the deluxe instead of standard as i would've loved to see the behind the scenes work put into this game, as well as have the phenomenal soundtrack which made at least made me have a lot of frission.",

        "content": "TL,DR: It's not quite as good as the original game, but it's a spin-off, so what do you expect? The style is much more hack-and-slash and doesn't allow for nearly as much sneakery, but I still like it. I think it's easier than the og game, so if you want a challenge, you'll probably need to turn up the difficulty later on. The story is good, but could have benefited from a little more work. The game keeps crashing for me, and it got more frequent after I updated my computer, but I'm only passable with computers, so I don't know what to attribute that to. It could just be my computer, honestly.\n\nOkay, so I really love the game, because I missed Persona 5 and wanted to play it again but I don't own it (I stayed with my cousin and played it while I was there) but recently, it's been crashing about every hour or so so I updated my computer to see if that would help, and it just made the crashes more frequent. Unfortunately, I'm no computer geek, so I have no idea what's going on or why and no way to figure it out because I'm scared of messing stuff up even more and also because I wouldn't know what I'm looking at. I can't tell if this is an issue with my computer, which is a zephyr gaming computer, I think, so it's fairly beefy compared to my old dell, or if it's an issue with the game. The game itself is very good if you're just looking for more Persona 5 content, but this game isn't in the same, turn-based style of gameplay, so be warned. It's a more of a battle royale with fewer options for sneaking around in the shadows. Personally, I've found it much easier than the original game and have turned it up to the hard difficulty, but I enjoy it nevertheless. I haven't finished the game yet, but I've found the story to be quite interesting. Not nearly as complex and planned out as the original game, mind you, but I wasn't expecting it to be perfect. I've been playing the game infrequently, so pardon my lapses in memory. The cooking mechanic is interesting, but they don't offer too many sp items for just one party member. There are several for full party, but the coffee beans needed to make Leblanc's coffee are offered very infrequently. I also feel like the areas you stay at get a little boring after a while, because it does take a good amount of time to beat a Jail (which is the Palace substitute. Jails are more for people with trauma who didn't deal with it in healthy ways and didn't get help, I think). Overall, I think it's a pretty good game with an interesting addition to the view of the Persona 5 Metaverse. It could use some work, but perfection isn't real or a healthy expectation to have. It's best enjoyed if you're just looking for something new to play once you've finished with Persona 5 and want a new story in the same universe. It does keep crashing, but I don't know if that's my computer or the game so I can't really comment on that.",

        "content": "First off, you will have to have beaten Persona 5 do its ending to understand this game. And that is not a game for the faint of heart, it requires a significant time investment. But damn, is it worth it. And this game stands on its own as a fantastic sequel and spinoff. It is the first truly great Dynasty-Warriors type spinoff I've ever played. All the others have ranged from bad-mediocre. But this game stands on the shoulders of Persona 5 and has a fantastic combat system, story, music, and characters. Only complaints are that the plot takes a little while to get on its feet, some predictability in the plot, the lack of exp for members not in your party leaving them underleveled whenever you want to change your party setup, and the relative simplicity of the individual characters' movesets when compared to other games of this type. Otherwise, a fantastic game. Totally reccomend.",

The color design and overall aesthetic is exciting and engaging. The story, comic book-like dialogue and animated cut scenes all offer a solid story and presentation. \n\nThe combat difficulty is very fair w/o being brain dead easy and manages to stay just \"fresh\" enough. The ability to play as different party members, use various Peronas, Showtime attacks and so forth keeps the gameplay engaging. \n\nThe stealth mechanic + all out attack has gotten a little old at just 10 hours in. The story, overall game aesthetic and other combat mechanics help carry the game through this weakness.\n\nIf you have not played Persona 5 check out the P5 Plot synopsis on Wikipedia. This will allow you to better understand why the Phantom Thieves don't like the cops, what a Palace is, etc. With that background you will better appreciate the plot and story of P5S.\n\nOverall I give this game an 8/10.",

        "content": "Hello  there  ,  hope you are doing well  . I have finished the game but for some reason I forgot to write a review for this amazing game . So , let me begin by saying that if you haven't played Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal ,stay way  from this game at all costs  if you don't want your experience to be ruined (If you have specific questions about that ask  me in the comments and i will  try to explain  as much  spoiler free as possible) . Since  I am afraid that I might spoil  something and the fact that  English is not my mother tongue language , I will be short  :\nPros  : \n- Soundtrack :  Even though  this is a sequel/spin off and clearly I thought that the budget is gonna be less , I expected that  the quality  would not be as good as Persona 5/Royal , the game absolutely  destroyed my negative expectations . I can safely say that the quality of the different songs of  this game were on par with the soundtrackk of Persona 5 if not better . And  Lyn Inaizumi with her superb tone and really good control on the high notes, a great overall performance as always . Give her some love please on Twitter .\n- Engine : I really don't know what Engine did they use on Persona 5 strikers but  the textures for characters ,objects,game terrain are light  years more clean than the  Persona 5 Royal (which have a slight upgrade on it's graphics in comparison with  the vanilla Persona 5) . And  even though this is anime or as some smart people like to say it ''a weeb'' game , the game looks soooooooo good in 4K  60 fps and everything  on the highest  settings to the  point that I could not believe it . \n-Gameplay: At first ,  when it first was announced for the Japanese market I thought that the gameplay will be  broken , poorly made or whatever you want to call . And I was sure (for some reason) that this type  of gameplay will absolutely not  fit well on a Persona game so decided to ignore it since I believed that it won't have a Western release . After some time when the game was announced for the West , I decided  to take the risk (due to my bias towards the Persona franchise and Atlus)  and preorder the digital deluxe . So the early access released  and  I started playing . Not only it is not boring  but it also has so many many creative mechanics that build on the Dynasty Warriors gameplay  formula and make it wayyyyy more fun  than I expected and it  felt so good using the different new  mechanics  .\n-Story (SPOILER FREE) : Even though I have the bias i already mentioned above  ,  I never expected the story of this spin off (which also servers a sequel to Persona 5) to be so well crafted . Of course , not as big (that\u2019s what she said) and good as the Persona but so much better than your everyday spinn off \n-Duration/NG+ : First of all , the playtime I currently have is not  accurate because I have spent  1-2 hours looking  at the preorder bonuses . Also this is the duration of my first playthough and I haven't started yet NG+ .  NG+  is neccessary if you want to earn al the achievements . I am the type of player that likes to look every nook and cranny of the game , unlock  all the abilities for the characters , do all the side quests first  and then start doing the main story to unlock new side quests (and repeat ) until I finish the game  . \n Cons: \nThe only  thing I didn't like was the epilogue(it was rushed in my opinion but it probably they didn't have the apropriate budget to make it  smoother , I can't be  sure )  and fact that [spoiler] you can predict after a certain point  in the main story who the main antagonist is so I wish they would have hidden this person  better but it didn't bother me that much . Don't make that stop you from buying it , it is just my personal whining [/spoiler]\n\nOoof , I wrote more than I expected . Before  I  leave please leave  a comment if you  have anything to ask before buying in the comments . Have a great day and stay safe !!!!!!",

(Why Atlus, release a sequel on PC without making the first game available prior to that?) The story therefore starts with all characters from the prequel already knowing each others and hints to the events of the prequel.\n\n- There are no social links like in other Persona games.\n\n+ The combat system is different from the rest of the Persona series (realtime and not turn based), but seems interesting enough at first glance.\n\n- The soundtrack of the deluxe edition is not contained as seperate files, but rather a DRM protected software that allows you to listen to the music. Don't buy the deluxe edition for the soundtrack! It's a trap!",

        "content": "NEW REVIEW\nYeah I had problems with the full screen but I don't anymore due to the updates.\nThis game runs at perfect 60 fps on my 600 dlls Acer Nitro. It's a beast of a game. The story is detailed and great. I personally skip it sometimes because it's a ton of dialogue but the content is quality and human. Great game to relax.\nThe moves are simple and fun the brawling and mechanism feel perfectly integrated with the rpg elements and the world plus the story make it all for a very immersive experience.\n\nI still prefer Persona 5 though hopefully they port that to PC. I already have it on console but It's way too convenient being able to play persona on just my laptop PLEASE DO THIS NOW",

OR you will love the combat because even though I thought the turn based battle were the best way to go with the game. Being able to play as ANY of the Phantom Thieves was really nice and being able to fight and get battle over quickly but it is still challenging to fight some enemies. THE LAST THING I WILL SAY IS THAT YOU.NEED.TO.PLAY.WITH.A.CONTROLLER. Otherwise you will be messing with your key binds and it makes it feel very weird to play. Other than that I would 100% recommend this game",

I've already beaten this game on the Nintendo Switch, and I loved it so much that I simply had to buy it again. I think it may very well be my favorite \"Warriors\"-styled game yet, and it is absolutely a worthy sequel to the original Persona 5. I would highly recommend that anyone even remotely interested in this game to pick it up.",

        "content": "Satisfying continuation of Persona 5, that comes with everything you'd expect from a game that shares the \"Persona 5\" namesake. My only complaints with the gameplay were that it played more like a Platinum or Action RPG like the Tales of games instead of a Dynasty Warriors style of game. You're not quite chewing through hordes of grunt enemies effortlessly, but you're also not just focusing combos into a single enemy. It's a hybrid of the two that took a little adjusting to figure out, but the story was quite a trip (pun intended).",

        "content": "An excellent balance between classic Persona gameplay, and hack-and-slash madness.\n\nI'll won't deny in saying that I never actually played the original Persona 5/Royal, having only watched my friend stream the game. But I can still say with certainty that the flair, writing, and characters feel straight out of the main game. While this may be labeled as a \"Spinoff\", it is just as much a true sequel to the original Persona 5. (Not Royal.)\n\nDespite being seen as a \"Warriors\" spinoff of sorts like other series received (Such as Hyrule Warriors or Fire Emblem Warriors), Strikers keeps many of the aspects that make the Warriors games have their flair and charm, while also keeping many story and gameplay aspects that make it feel like a true Persona game as well. The use of skills, weakness exploitation, and even Joker's Wild Card ability are all present, and translated faithfully in the newer hack-and-slash gameplay style. While at the same time still feeling like a dedicated RPG. I'm honestly impressed how well they kept the feel of Persona in the gameplay, not making it feel too alienated as a sequel to P5. (Unlike with my experience with games like Hyrule Warriors, which feels like a Warriors game, but with Zelda characters slapped onto it.) Even so; the gameplay is still very different from regular Persona. It just is faithful in carrying over a lot of signature aspects of the series.\n\nAnd as for the story; I really enjoyed it as well. I won't go into many details, but I can still say for certain that it feels like a natural progression from the ending of Persona 5.\nThe characters all feel the same, they all keep their original voices, and some characters who may have been lacking in P5 got more development and purpose in Strikers. (Primarily with Haru.)\nEven though there are no longer any social aspects in Strikers, the writing and character interactions still feel like what you'd see in regular Persona, albeit a bit more linear. Which honestly; I don't have a problem with.\nI also really enjoyed the new characters added to the game, especially Zenkichi.\n\nAll-in-all, P5 Strikers is a fantastic game, especially if you're a fan of P5 already.\nMy only gripe is that due to being a sequel to P5, you kinda need to see the story of the base game's True Ending to understand a lot of points covered in the story of Strikers. But at the same time; if your there just for the gameplay and not so much the story (Or you just don't mind spoilers), then the game itself has its own content and story to look forward to. Even if you may not pick up on all the references made to the previous game.\n\nEven still; I highly recommend this game. Truly a real treat for me to play this year",

Everything except combat is more of the same in a very good way, fresh and new but familiar. \n\nCombat is a whole different beast, and while I thought it was pretty shaky at first, I grew to very much enjoy it a couple of levels in. It's reminiscent of a Dynasty Warriors style brawler, but most fights with masses of enemies are very short. Bosses are considerably more durable, and will mash you if you only swing mindlessly. Personally I blew through the early fights until I hit the first real boss, died enough times in a row that the game recommended I switch to easy difficulty (not happening), and went back to the tutorials to really learn all the mechanics. Started having a blast shortly after that.\n\nCharacters are charming and engaging, but it does have the hallmark cringe perv scenes endemic to anime (not egregious, but in poor taste).",

        "content": "It's pretty fuckin fun. It's worth the standard price, but when it's on sale it's even more worth purchasing if you like action games. \n\nIt's very satisfying when you're good at it. You get to kick ass and look super f*cking cool while doing so. The soundtrack also hypes you up a LOT when things start picking up. \n\nVery good game. I understand it might not be for everyone, but it tickles my fancy very nicely.",

        "content": "Atlus knows how to milk a franchise really well. Instead of creating dairy products that becomes expired even before they are shipped, they ensure that all of their cows are in good health alongside carrying out daily inspections and QC procedures on their machines before doing anything. Almost every single one of their spin offs are made with love and care. \n\nThat includes Persona 5 Strikers. The turn-based + musou hybrid is what I would like to see in future musou games. Although the combos provided for each character are less varied, it does not overstay its welcome as they are also numerous persona skills that we can use to defeat a horde of enemies. On top of that, by utilizing the baton pass from P5, we can control 4 different characters in a single map. Something that most musou titles lack. In addition, the game includes two new playable characters. An AI girl named Sophia and another one which I am not going to mention the name to avoid spoiler territory. Trust me, they fit so well in the phantom thieves gang and each of them will receive their own spotlights they deserve. \n\nAN IMPORTANT NOTE: \n\nDo not play this game, if you have not yet play the mainline game or at least watch a walkthrough on youtube. Bits of the plot from P5 will be mentioned a few times so proceed with caution. \n\nIf you love persona 5, then you will surely going to like strikers as well, Don't let the musou tag turn you off, the combat feels natural and not overly repetitive like the traditional musou games. Of course, it depends on peoples' preferences at the end of the day. As expected from Atlus, their remarkable assortment of musical pieces are unique, memorable and well-composed as always. For those who want a fairly lengthy JRPG, then persona 5 strikers is perfect for you too judging by the total amount of hours I spent to complete all 50 side quests which will appear as an achievement if you manage to unlock it + beating the main story. \n\n*CUTE AI GIRL GO BRRR*\n",

        "content": "This is definitely for fans of Persona 5. The Musou style combat takes a lot of getting used to, weather or not you're accustomed to Dynasty Warriors or not, it's pretty different, and I had to change the difficulty to Easy until I got the hang of things and then reset it to Normal. \n\nIt has some clunkiness, but the story will keep you going if you liked P5. This is a direct sequel, so definitely play this for the story if nothing else.\n\nBeing an action game, you control each Phantom Thief individually, and can freely switch between them. they all fight quite differently and have their own combos/specials, and you'll most likely find one or two that you like and stick with them for most of the game.\n\nYou still obtain Personas and Joker can equip/fuse them etc in the Velvet room. But with so many characters to play as (8 other than Joker) I barely found any use in directly controlling Joker. Why use a fire based Persona when Ann can already use fire spells and use her fire whip moves that cost no SP? And same with each other Phantom Thief with their respective elemental spells. It made sense in a turn-based RPG like the original  P5, but here you can just hack/slash/spell cast to your hearts content.\n\nAll in all a fun, mindless game that honestly needs tweaking in the combat department, but I'd still recommend this to fans of P5 for the story, and to see these beloved characters return in a new setting.",

        "content": "It's hard to say this as Persona 5 and Persona 4 are some of my favourite games of all time, but this game has some below average gameplay. Boss fights can drag on and fights with random enemies are either frustrating or too easy. It seems like I spend most of my time spamming shoot rather than pulling off combos and using magic because enemies do too much damage. SP is much better spent using healing spells rather than elemental or buff / debuff spells because damage is so high. You can use other characters, but why would you when Joker is the best one to be using. Maybe it's because is just came off playing the One Piece Pirate Warriors series but the lack of variety during combat drags this game down. Usually your combo is 1,1,1,2 or 1,1,1,1,1,2,2 (1 being a light attack and 2 being a heavy attack), because those combos use your equipped persona's element (which means you don't have to spend precious SP on offensive magic to hit weaknesses). \n\nThe Velvet Room and persona fusion are cut down and almost a waste of time in this game. You cannot just fuse any two personas anymore. There are set combinations you can use. This is sad because this is what originally drew me to the Persona series in the first place. \n\nHowever, combat and the Velvet Room are the only bad things about this game. Just like Persona 5, the UI and design elements to this game are fantastic. Seeing your equipped persona in the bottom left of the screen always looks cool because there is a unique portrait there for every persona. Menu transitions don't get in the way too much and are worth the time they use. \n\nThe main characters are just as I knew them in Persona 5 (with the disappointing lack of Dr. Maruki and Sumi from the Royal version of the game). Yusuke still makes me laugh. Ryuji is still endearingly dumb. Haru gets more screen time (thank god) and Makoto is still best girl. The new characters Sophia and Mr. Bloodborne (forgot his actual name) are lovely and fit in very well with the main group, with Sophia genuinely being my fourth favourite character (behind Yusuke, Makoto and Haru).\n\nTake this review lightly, as I've only beaten the 2nd Palace and I'm working through the 3rd one right now. I just wanted to write down my feelings on this game so far.",

While this game is fun, there are a few caveats:\n\n* No matter what character you use, combat gets somewhat repetitive after a while. \n\n* This game is surprisingly long (at least, in my opinion).\n\n* If you want more enjoyment out of the story, you need to have played any version of Persona 5 first.\n\nHowever, this game has plenty of positives to warrant buying:\n\n* Awesome soundtrack.\n\n* Graphics are fantastic.\n\n* Fantastic boss designs.\n\n* RPG elements present (sort of like Final Fantasy 7 Remake).\n\n* And many more to discover for yourself!\n\n\nTLDR: A good game with shortcomings.",

The antagonists are really lame and don't really give you a drive to keep playing and along with your party members they feel like an after thought when side quests you do for them don't really make any social link event happen. Combat will also get too repetitive because it just becomes X and Y through the entire game with occasional oh maybe I will actually manually use my Persona's skills. All I can say is get it on sale",

Maybe not cannon(not entirely sure) but is perfected in so many ways similar to persona 5, and there are rarely any moments in the game where you are not feeling happy or accomplished within its difficult tasks. Its a wonderful game. And I would love to see maybe just 1 more game like it as another continuation, but possibly similar to persona 3? Not sure exactly but I would love to give some pointers to the developers and share opinions and ideas! But seriously, love the work and the innovations made inside, especially the 3D battlefield and Impossible mode, with the reaper and more! All the challenges are worth beating and playing because it feels nothing but rewarding and fun with the characters dialogue!",

        "content": "While this game's combat mechanics are fun and fresh in their divergence from Persona's normal turn-based gameplay, the story (while it has its moments) is a boring retread of material from past Persona games, and apart from the fanservice for players of Persona 5 I can't recommend this game on the merits of its narrative. The character of Sophie and her story arc is basically a recycling of Aigis from Persona 3; Zenkichi is just Dojima from Persona 4, the reprisal of the Persona 3/4 hot springs scene (they are all the same scene) is unnecessary, unfunny, and tired. etc.\n\nI'm a pretty big Persona fan, and I've enjoyed this game. Its story is serviceable, not embarrassingly bad or even unenjoyable. But if you have played a Persona game, and especially if you have played Persona 3 and 5, you have played this game. The only difference is the gameplay, which, again, is still fun. I do appreciate them cutting the social links/calendar bullshit, because that was never really used well in past games, but there is still far too much busywork in between the dungeon crawling and combat\n\nThe PC port is fine, at least as far as I've found. It's only crashed a few times for me. But ymmv i guess\n\nHaru also continues to be good.\n\n[b]tldr; good combat, boring recycled story, slightly unstable port. play if you really need that much more persona in your veins, probably buy on a sale, don't expect too much. 3/5 - decent.[/b]",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is an excellent spin-off of Persona 5 and an overall fantastic Musou game. Based on vanilla P5, it leaves out  the new stories from Royal. It's unfortunate, but the new ideas they bring are really great, one of the new characters is really compelling and an excellent addition to the cast. It's definitely a game I'd recommend to anyone who enjoyed Persona 5. It's a fun continuation with a good story and the Phantom Thieves hanging out and travelling across Japan. This might seem obvious, but if you weren't a fan of P5 then this game won't do much for you. Long stretches of cutscenes and characters the game expects you to be familiar with won't be too appealing if you haven't been sucked into the world of P5. Only other major complaint is the post-game, or lack thereof. It's disappointing, especially for a Musou game that can usually have you spend over 100 hours trying to complete the various missions. \n\nOverall though, like I said, Persona 5 Strikers is an excellent game and one that any fan of Persona 5 should play.",

The characters were all very likable and made you want to spend as much time with them doing meaningless shenanigans with them and wishing you could have had more of them at the end of the game which is what strikers manages manages give you in spades as the game is essentially you and your mates go on a road trip and just get into random shenanigans which is just generally enjoyable.\n\nAlong with that this game's combat system is one that manages to be very fast paced and mobile while still maintaining the style and feel that p5 had, overall being honestly more enjoyable to spend time with as it manages not to get repetitive overtime and maintains the vibrant and fast paced feel that it has when you first experience it which is all enhanced by the soundtrack that fits the the designs of the areas they accompany or make you feel invincible as you go through waves of enemies.\n\nAll and all I had a blast with this game and would recommend it to anyone who is willing to pick it up.",

Additionally, since the game takes place on the road over a short time period with characters you already know, the time management and social links have been replaced by bond skills, which are much simpler and a bit less satisfying. Despite these huge changes to the formula, [i]Strikers[/i] manages to strongly hold on to it's [i]Persona[/i] identity. [i]Persona 5 Strikers[/i] is both a worthy sequel and a blast in it's own right, and I enthusiastically recommend it to anyone who enjoyed P5, and probably to any hack'n'slash/jrpg/arpg fans too.

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is like what Age of Calamity was for Breath of the Wild: A must-have experience for fans\n\nThe whole game feels more like a Persona game than a Warriors one, and the mechanics that Persona fans are familiar with, such as fusing, were greatly improved from even Persona 5 Royal. The things that were changed and made to be different to reflect upon its direction, such as the combat, is incredibly fun, rewards skill, and is something I found myself enjoying over the original turn-based formula that the Persona series is known for.\n\nIf you're looking for a less time-consuming Persona experience with a greater development into its combat than with time management around tasks and social links, then this should be up your alley. Despite the feeling of being a Persona-lite title, its gameplay loop is meaty and offers an incentive for fighting battles for stat boosters and a constant means of getting stronger. I'm playing NG+ on the hardest difficulty, and it's still feeling adequately challenging enough to keep me on my toes despite having Personas that would make the previous games into a laughing stock.\n\nIf you're unsure about getting it at full price, then be sure to pick it up when it's on a sale. You won't regret it. The Digital Deluxe Edition is worth it for the little extras especially the legacy BGM tracks.",

        "content": "10/10 game, now keep it up and bring the rest of the Persona franchise to PC.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nPersona 5 Strikers is a step in a brand new direction for the entire Persona franchise, yet entirely fits all of the knowledge we currently have on the series. Every single translation of a skill from the JRPG format to the Dynasty Warriors format makes complete sense. The combat system feels incredible and flows perfectly with the styles of all of the Phantom Thieves, each of the Thieves' fighting style perfectly matching their character. The game also encourages you to use all of the Phantom Thieves (and no spoilers, you should it helps later on), beyond just using them to hit weaknesses.  The game may feel difficult, as bosses can have an insane amount of health if you don't have maxed equipment or the best Personas, but remember that the game encourages you to spend a lot of time in the Jails and that unlike the original Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal: [b]You can re-enter a Jail as many times as you want on a single day, refreshing your HP/SP every single time.[/b]\n\n[h1]Story/Characters[/h1]\n\nThe story is entertaining, and the new characters are welcome additions to the Persona 5 cast. The new Phantom Thieves fit incredibly well with the others, and their additions to the cast prove that it's not just high school kids who can change reality. There's a good balance of comedy relief with serious plot points, and the game knows when to take itself in either direction. Without spoilers, the late-game stuff can get incredibly emotional if you're invested, and again fits with the rest of the series while trying something new. \n\n[h1]Voice Actors/Thank You[/h1]\n\nThe best part of this game is the English VA's. You can tell that every single one of them was having a blast in the recording studio, and became the Phantom Thieves [sttrike]more than any cringy fan on social media ever could[/strike]. It wasn't as obvious to me in Persona 5/Royal, but in this game it was clear that every single voice actor was having a blast and completely invested in their characters, which was something that couldn't necessarily be given during a first game in a series like P5/P5R. As the characters grew, so did the VA's and it really showed in this game. To the English Cast, thank you for an incredible performance, and can't wait for the next one.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nAll in all, wait for P5/P5R to come out on PC if you haven't played them already, or play it on PS4 since it's out there now. Persona 5 Strikers was an incredible experience that I can't wait to play over and over again to 100% and the point where I have every Persona completely maxed out. I'm incredibly happy to see that ATLUS doesn't need to make a JRPG to have an incredible entry into the Persona franchise.",

Mostly it will just be references to the original story won't make sense but doesn't keep you from following this ones story. It will spoil it though obviously so if you don't want that I would play 5 first. \n\nAlso the game play is completely different from the main line Persona games being made by Koei and if you played one of their games then that is what it plays like, combo beat up with summoning personas. All around I found it fun.",

A chance to see what happens after the events of the main game and an opportunity to go on another mission that expands the wold of the original. The new battle system is top-notch, and resembles the action-oriented battles of Final Fantasy VII Remake. Honestly, I would love if Persona 6 had a more refined version of the battle system in this game. It is so much fun to see the Phantom Thieves move about as they do in the cutscenes of the original game, but this time you're in control. The fusion system has been further simplified in service of removing many hard annoyances, but with the tradeoff of reduced Persona count. I would love to see a sequel to this game with a few small things changed, but as it stands I can heartily recommend this entry.",

It's no longer a JRPG or a social simulator, as it's all to do with a Warriors-like game and does it perfectly. The personas being incorporated into battle and having a different layout for each Jail is amazing, as well as the story and character interactions being perfect.",

        "content": "A very impressive and unique to the incredibly popular Persona 5. Initially seeing that it was being developed by Omega Force kinda put me on guard as I've never been a big fan of the Warriors series of games, but I was still curious. Turns out that this is probably my favorite of their games. Gameplay is a surprising blend of those Warrior games (fight huge swathes of enemies who might throw in a few hits here and there) and Persona's weakness/resistance system. You have your basic combos that develop as you play each of the characters and you can bust out their Persona to do attacks that enemies are susceptible to, to knock 'em down and do an ALL OUT ATTACK that does huge damage to every enemy around. Each character has their own combo strings and variants that they learn as you play as them, so each one feels unique to each other, so try each one and they might fit your play style better than another, aside from worrying about weaknesses.\n\nPresentation is great, aside from some minor jagged edge problems that you can fix if you look up how (I've forgotten how exactly, it's been a while, but it also made everything else a tad funky). The stylization of characters and the world is still spot on to Persona 5 (no surprise), runs mostly well and of course the music is still S-tier at worst. You'll definitely have new favorites after playing through this.\n\nThe story and new characters are also pretty solid! I love both Sophie and Zenkichi, they're colorful additions that don't feel out of place with the core cast at all. They're well fleshed-out on top of the main P5 cast getting some more time that they hadn't before and also allowed for some more interactions among each of them. Only issue is that some of the villains of each new zone you get to explore aren't as fleshed out. One being familiar with a teammate and you don't really get much more than \"I thought you were good before, but now this happened and you're bad.\" to \"Ah, sorry about the sudden bad. We cool now?\" and then you leave. I mean you learn more than that, obviously, but it doesn't hit as strongly as some other characters developments. And those who played any spinoffs or the Royal version: it's focused on Persona 5. Old character portraits are used as opposed to the refreshed ones in Royal, Sumi doesn't exist in this timeline and neither does all the Royal specific changes to the story. Gonna miss Sumi, she was great and hope they push her in likely spinoffs, along with Zenkichi and Sophie but we'll see as unlikely as it is.\n\nAll in all, absolutely loved this game so much so I 100% it. A bit easier to do than core Persona 5, and on par with Persona 5 Royal. If you've played Persona 5 and loved it, absolutely hop onto this game. If you've played Persona 5 Royal and loved that, you'll be a bit saddened or confused, if that's the only version you played. Either way, it's excellent!\n\n(PS, IF YOU'RE STRUGGLING: RYUJI IS A POWERHOUSE, UTILIZE PLAYING AS HIM.)",

This might be the entry persona game for players that dont like turn based rpgs but are curious about the persona subverse. Still as an avid Turn based rpg lover I think the pauses for menus and skill usage makes this game keep the charm of turn based rpgs while using action combat. Id give this game a 8 out of 10 as of now.",

It's nice being able to visit different cities and time isn't a factor here compared to P5. Will update review when I'm on NG+ but so far really love it <3\n\n(Sadayo Kawakami best girl)",

El gameplay es adictivo y divertido. Entre con un poco de miedo de que el gameplay sea igual al del Dynasty Warriors, el cual no me interesa; Pero no es el caso, este es mucho mas completo, interesante y adictivo. Al rededor de 40hs de historia. Recomendado!",

With the best parts from both series, some of which was changed to flow better with the other, the gameplay is excellent. Things to be wary of. Although it seems as if the story is just Persona 5 again, it isn't. Although it does tread over similar ground, the wholly unique aspects and new characters like Zenkichi make up for it. Also, on PC there's a slight chance of infinite load times. That being said however, I personally only encountered it once, so as long as you save frequently (mainly before major events) it isn't a hassle.",

The game have some a the greatest soundtrack in a Persona game I have the chances to listen too, they really capture the essence of Persona 5 and brought it forward in this one.\n\nIt's also a Great Musou type game which I honestly don't play a lot of but still manage to have fun while playing so. The combination of easy control, fast-paced gameplay,flashy combos and finisher really make the game enjoyable. Well at least for me a Persona fan.\n\nAll and all this is just a nice Musou type game with P5 aesthetic slap on top of it, I can guaranteed that you will have fun playing this game.",

I'm not nearly done with the game, but I've got enough time here to say that I'm pleased with how well this was made.\n\nI never expected that nearly every aspect of the game would be improved upon. The story is rich and drives in more development for the characters, songs have either been remixed and remastered to fit the action style (and nearly all of the new songs added are complete bops), and the style seen in P5 has been expanded upon and grown to a massive scale.\n\nThere are only a couple gripes I have. Very minor, but as it affects the gameplay itself, it feels rather sad to mention. I play this game for the story and music, but the gameplay was never all that engaging to me. Each of the fights had meperforming the same tactics, only changed by which boss I was going to face next. The bosses in this game are juggernauts, and it feels like they were only padded out just so that the in-fight dialogue could be heard. It just felt like there was too much health, and sometimes there were some really messed up moments between the AI and the bosses that just left you with almost nothing you could do (Hyodo without any tables left is a notable jerk that's for sure).\n\nOverall I enjoyed it, though. Still trying to get through merciless mode, which is its own can of worms, but I still quite enjoy it.",

New character \"Humanity's Companion\" is cute as F***. Not recommended for those just looking for a new hack n' slash, a lot of dialogue disrupts the pacing. Fans are used to it, you have been warned.\n\nPros------------------------\n\n-Unique Mushou combat experience with Persona 5 theme. All out attacks, Persona System\n\n-Story picks up after events of Persona 5 after one year\n\n-Music is great\n\n-English Va's put on a great performance (subjective I understand)\n\n-Japanese voices are optional if you are not into English dubs \n\n-New Baddies (I have only fought the first boss so far) \n\n-Checkpoints are placed pretty well and makes re-entry less of a hassle taking out a lot of backtracking.\n\n-Humanity's Companion > Siri\n\n-Ambushing shadows feels great\n\nCons-------------------------\n\n- Camera can be wacky\n\n- Game is not good for players who have not played the original. No backstory, no summary of events, no recap of the original game whatsoever. \n\n- If you have not played the original, you will not be used to dialogue. There is a TON of dialogue. Great if you are a fan, annoying if you are new to the series or are just looking for a hack n' slash.\n\n- Most of the characters you bonded with in last game are MIA if they were not the main cast. Doctor, where you be? :<\n\n- \"Stealth\"    Yeah, it's pretty whack.",

I think the battle system is complementing the turn based style and make it so fun. It's not just vs thousand enemies but there is also strategy to how you can fight this many enemies.",

        "content": "P5S is a fun follow-up to P5/P5R in the form of a 3D beat-em-up. Giant waves of enemies come at you and there's occasionally a boss who does big damage yet can be stunned for your own big damage if you hit it's weakness enough. Sounds like Persona/SMT gameplay in an action environment? You'd be correct.\n\nThere's balance issues with characters strengths and weaknesses but it never forces you into a unwinnable situation; plus the balance between Persona elements and beat-em-up elements was more important and they succeeded there. You have to keep an eye on your skills mostly for stronger enemies and to improve combos but if you're exceedingly talented at these kinds of games you could ignore it...but the system is fun so there's no reason to. The story is a bit shallow with our returning cast while the new faces (at least the good guys) get character development that's pretty logical and nice, but it probably won't leave the biggest impression on you. It's moreso a reason to see Ren, Ryuji, Yusuke, Makoto, Futaba etc. again and get what would be confidant cut-scenes in P5 but stretched through the whole game. The game is  gorgeous and despite it being frantic I would stop after clearing an area to look around. I was worried when the characters looked a little off when it was revealed but they look fine in-game alongside the demons and levels you'll explore.\n\nIt's a fun sequel that doesn't push the envelope outside of introducing RPG menus and abilities to Samurai Warriors like gameplay. If you like Persona 5 it's a great. simple and significantly shorter. It allows extra time with the Phantom Thieves too, especially Haru! and don't worry - one thief won't take up a ton of the main plot this time. Makoto, I'm staring lazers at you. Gameplay design also feels similar despite the new combat style as managing your abilities before heading into a jail is where the real challenge comes in and then using those abilities sparingly. It's fun and enjoyable, do consider getting it!\n\nIf you don't like P5...you'll think it's pretty I guess. It's another warriors game with the ability to do an attack from a menu that does more damage. I do think unless you are *really* into the game's art style, you could do better with other games on Steam.",

I wouldn't even call this a spin-off but this is a true sequel in my books.\n\nThe games \"social\" system might not be as deep as in the original game but for what it's worth it does its job well letting you do optional quests for your companions and encounter in optional dialouge during your spare time and you'll be constantly interacting with you companions throughout the story.\n\nIf you have played the original Persona 5 Game this is a must play. A true masterpiece with a deep plot and good mechanics\n\noverview:\n+ Deep and well crafted engaging plot that is simply outstanding\n+ Combat is very fun and at times very engaging\n+ Persona Creation and modification feature is well crafted and goes as deep as you're willing to go\n+ Atmosphere and environments are outstanding\n+ soundtrack is excellent\n+ Character encounters throughout the game are enchanting and deep",

The game is fun, and has sidequests you can do for rewards such as money, experience, new weapons, items, etc. There is a ton of replayability. Especially on New Game + you can unlock. I would give this game a 10/10 \n\nThese guides for the game made some parts easier and just a helpful way to make sure you get thing 100% : \n\n100% achievement guide : https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2400553355 \n\nAll requests guide : https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2401580370",

The action is supposed to be fun, but i never did like the Dynasty Warrior format - and while this isn't quite as endlessly horde-wavish, there's still a bit too much going on when spamming buttons.  I miss the pace of the RPG, and maybe I haven't really given the game system enough of a chance, yet.  Art/music is spot on - but I'll need to sit down and just play it thru a bit more - and maybe I'll be able to love it, too.",

        "content": "\"iT's SMT WiThOuT tHe hEaRt aND a DaSh oF dYnAsTy wArRiOrS.\" - IGN 2021.\n\nThe story/setting:\nThis game continues the story line from the original Persona 5 ending. It follows Joker and the Phantom Thieves as they traverse around Japan during their summer vacation with many exciting locales and palaces (jails) to explore and fight through! Anyone who has played the previous titles (P5/P5R) will understand many of the references made in this title.\n\nGameplay:\nCombat has been changed from turn based to a more dynasty warriors-esque 1 vs 100 type deal but still having the familiar persona combat system implemented in its RPG predecessor. Each member of the phantom thieves have their own unique persona to level up and as well as melee combos to learn which can be quite satisfying. Being able to see each member of the phantom thieves in combat fighting shadows alongside Joker is quite pleasing. Each individual character have a \"show-time\" ability that is built up through combat and it acts as a ultimate skill from each character's specific personas.\n\nWhile it took a little time to get used to, using personas in combat can be quite hectic since combat quite fast paced and would be more difficult if not for the time freeze when aiming skills over an area of enemies. Anyone who has played previous Persona or SMT titles will be familiar with the weakness system. Additionally fusion of personas (or  demons) returns again in this title with a more simplified system than it's predecessors.\n\nRPG elements:\nA lot of the social interactions between individual characters have been stripped out, in favor of a bond system that levels up and gives points for you to allocate into improving the phantom thieves team abilities as a whole. While there are still group events and small hang out events between characters that give you bond points and additional rewards for completing them all of the romance and dating systems in the main line games have been completely removed.\n\nVerdict:\nPersona 5 Strikers is a perfectly balanced game that takes the RPG elements of its predecessors and implements it well into a dynasty warriors type of game. While I do wish that social links were still a part of this game, the gameplay and story will easily keep any persona/SMT fan entertained for over 70 - 80 hours long depending on how much of a completionist you are.",

        "content": "I think of all the Personas I've played, this one really helped cement the team, not just as Phantom Thieves, but as actual friends. This one felt so much more personal, like the voice actors had SO MUCH FUN playing these characters and adding their personal touch to it. I especially loved the new characters as well, especially Sophia. She made me tear up multiple times. My favorite team was the P4 Investigation Team, but this game really made me connect the Phantom Thieves so much more. \n\nNow moving to combat, combat feels GOOD. Much better than most other Musou games, as it certainly feels like Atlus/Sega really had their hands in this to feel like a Musou game, but kept the theme and fighting to still feel like a Persona game. All the Thieves had their own showtimes, combat arts, and everyone just felt different in all the right ways. \n\nLastly, the music BUMPS. Persona games have always nailed this, but GOTDAMN this game got the tunes perfect! Every city and the tunes that follow it work for the areas. Everything like coming into the jails, the song playing for the big moments like \"Daredevil\", the title song \"You are Stronger\" Much better than P5 originally, as some palaces didn't really have themes that fit them well. \n\nMy biggest complaint as of now, is the crashing. The game crashes a good amount during some loading screens. Wasn't enough to deter me from playing, since I save almost every time I go to the hideout, before I have to load to the next area, but I was very nervous during some cutscenes.\n\nAll in all, super fun game. I loved every minute of it, and it didn't super overstay its welcome like P5 did. P5R helped manage the time better, and this game, every moment felt impactful and kept me on my toes.\n\n10/10. Gonna miss the Phantom Thieves a bunch.",

        "content": "Haru gets more screen time, so yeah, it's good. \n\nStrikers is a direct sequel to 5 and since Atlus are dumb lazy cunts that hate money, you will need to emulate 5 vanilla on rpcs3 before you play this. \n\nStrikers is not a turn-based rpg like the previous game, it's purely an action game, similar to Dynasty Warriors. I usually hate musou shit, but this one is pretty fun. The combat is neat and i really enjoyed the way you use your personas powers in real time with combos to counter enemy weaknesses, just like the turn-based game.\n\nAnyway, Strikers is a worthy sequel. If you enjoyed Persona 5 characters and story you will definitely enjoy this one too.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is exactly what I was hoping for as a Persona 5 spinoff/sequel. It continues the story of P5 in a similar, yet new way and continues to build the characters of P5.\n\nI found the gameplay very enjoyable, with it's unconventional turn-based RPG mechanics mixed in with the action gameplay. The action felt just right, you're able to dash around and attack just like in devil may cry but at the push of a button every stops and it becomes much more like a turn based rpg.\nI don't think they could have implemented this much better, so kudos.\n\nJust like the original the soundtrack is great. I personally prefer it to the original P5, but this is just my style of music. They even added in some Remixes of the original games music.\n\nLastly the story. I find it very good. It has been streamlined with story progression now being tied to your in-game progression, since there is no calendar system. I'm sure it would have been nice to see all characters from P5 return, but think it's better this way. The new additions fit in well too (mostly).\nThe real crime with the story of this game is a PC and switch exclusive problem. The original games aren't on these platforms and therefore many people are most likely going to be out of the loop when starting the game. Therefore they may miss some of the more subtle things, not understand everything or just not care. \n\nIn terms of the port, I did not have any big issues. Some framedrops when things got heated. I did have a few crashes, but only about six or seven in 70+ hours of playtime. Sidenote: This was also within the first two weeks of the games release. I have not tried 1.02 but I assume that is even better. \n\nOverall I recommend this game. It's really great. My biggest issue with it is that the NG+ difficulty might as well be called BS mode, so yeah. Great game. Worth your money.\n...\nBut there's a catch.\nI recommend you at least have basic knowledge of the previous game. I got through just fine knowing the base plot of the P5 and having watched the anime(yes the anime does cover most of the important things). Let's just hope that Atlus do eventually port Persona 5 (Royal) to PC, but I think it's basically a given at this point. :)",

Since there i was thinking how, the way I did to get here and reflect, every day about the saga. And then i remember i have to finish one more game for finish this saga. And that game was Persona 5 Strikers.\n\nIn that moment i knew that P5S, wasn\u00b4t realy like is going to be masterpiece, but i was thinking that is going to be a good game and one to remember. so one week later after finish p5r, i buy this game and started to play the game.\n\nAnd two week later i taken out all the trophies, and i was feeling sad and odd. The structure of history was litterally like p5 (original game, not the royal), i feel like the game took all the things that i don\u00b4t like about p5 history and put again, but this time worse, but that didn't make me not cry at the end of the game, even so i feel like the game was missing something: the essence that the persona games have. and the very essence of p5, inclusive i doubt myself about all the persona games is masterpieces and then i reflect about this game, clearly for me p5s isn\u00b4t like a true persona game, even like p5/p5r sequel, but it\u00b4s have his moments, i cry and laugh, is still a good game and can be enjoy so much, like the gameplay or the soundtrack (Is quite impresive as always), but as a fan of the series and Atlus games, i personally don\u00b4t like too much this game.",

I really like the Persona series, but this game just didn't do it for me. The story was boring, the cities were empty with nothing to do, the gameplay was just a warriors game. I spent not even 35 hours playing the game and when I was playing it I just wasn't really enjoying it. The soundtrack is the one thing that I don't have any issue with, its pretty good. But if you really like the Persona series, sure go ahead and buy it. And if its on sale for like $30 or under then sure, go ahead and buy it. But like man I was expecting so much more from the game because of all the advertising and hype it got. The main thing I wish it had done was added stuff to do in the cities, like mainline Persona games have done.",

Which is fine, because the old stuff is good.\n\nGameplay was enjoyable for me on Normal as somebody completely unfamiliar with Warriors / Musou games. Every character is pretty useful throughout, and identifying the best strategies for them is rewarding. Bosses can be pretty damage-spongy though, and you definitely will feel underleveled if you try those very-powerful-demon requests as soon as you get them.\n\nRan very well on my system, without any noticeable issues aside from one random crash. Game lets you save freely outside of dungeons and at any checkpoint within them, so impact of those can be minimal.",

The story is alright, but the characters are a bit one-note and often feel more like tropes than characters. It's hard to explain, but I've been playing on and off since launch and still haven't finished. I just haven't had the desire to play. The game runs pretty good, although it is locked at 60FPS. \n\nIf you like warriors games, definitely pick it up. Otherwise I'd wait for a good sale. I think 30-40 dollars is good. My only huge complaint is the difficulty. Easy feels way too easy but normal feels a bit too hard- I wish there was something in the middle.",

It is important to note that some fights are way easy even on hard mode because of the area damage that all the attacks do, but as always you cant just simply spam the same, you will run out if stamina, so that keeps the strategic side of the franchise alive, and I'm glad of that. \n\nThe soundtrack is fabulous as always",

        "content": "Excellent game.  It's a really good blend of Persona meets Dynasty Warriors with a little more strategy involved (like having abilities that enemies are weak to will greatly help keep you alive or beat enemies.)\n\nNot only is this game super fun to play, but the story that goes with it is also really good.  The only downside to the story is that some people might be a little lost of what's going on in terms of characters and stories, mainly because this game deals with a time period after Persona 5.  \n\nI would love to see more games exactly like this, or even a sequel to this game.  Just hoping this helps bring Persona 5 to PC so that other people can enjoy that game and relate to this game a little more!",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a sequel to the original Persona 5 (You kinda have to ignore the new additions of P5R, sorry Kasumi!)\nStorywise the game is so good and actually surprised me since I didn't expect a good story at all! \nBut I don't want to talk a single thing about the story even if they won't be considered as spoilers because it's the best if you enter the game blindly! But also the game needs the player to know one thing and another about the phantom thieves, some other characters, persona aspects, etc. It's not 100% necessary tho but trust me you can't understand/enjoy much of the story if it is your first ever persona game! \nMany people think that Persona 5 strikers is a Dynasty Warriors game with a persona theme but nope, it's much more like a real-time action Jrpg than that.\nThe combat system is not turn-based anymore,instead it features real-time combo based combat which is a new&cool experience IMO. For me the combat was starting to get boring and smash button like in the first jail of the game but then I changed the difficulty to hard and also the game introduced more challenging enemies, so if you don't want to feel the same play on high or at least medium difficulty and also don't ignore dire shadows.\nThe combat is pretty enjoyable and a nice addition to the old turn-based combat system.\nMany main factors of P5 or persona series in general are removed or been cut down in Persona 5 strikers such as Velvet room, Social links, daily calender system, and many other stuff that are all simplified/removed. \nOverall, P5 strikers is a must play for P5 fans who couldn't wait to see phantom thieves again! but if you haven't played P5 yet or even any other persona games and also if you can't get along with the new simplified aspects of the game,then you should probably ignore the game/wait for sales.\n\nNow please keep bringing persona games to steam Atlus ! \n\nP4 Spoiler P.S: [spoiler] Adachi is the best striker! Such a pity he was busy buying cabbage so he couldn't make it to this game [/spoiler]",

        "content": "A fantastic continuation of the P5 story, though you'll need to have played the original Persona 5 (on PS3) or Royal (on PS4/5) to understand what is going on at all -- as of writing, there's no native PC versions of those games. so maybe hold off on buying this until you find a way to play those.\nStory-wise, the game is more of the same, at least at a glance. Go into Metaverse and change the hearts of villains. However, there are a few twists and turns regarding it this time around that significantly change how it feels, but I will not spoil the specifics.\nIn terms of gameplay, well, this is an action game, not a turn-based RPG. Despite that, it's an excellent translation of traditional Persona gameplay into this new genre. However, you need to be ready to actually rely on melee attacks and items instead of just spamming spells this time around, because the game will drain your SP like there's no tomorrow otherwise.\nAs far as social links are concerned, well, there are none. This is understandable, since you are supposed to already know the characters well enough for this not to be necessary. There are still a few optional sidequests that offer little bits and pieces of character development here and there, but for the most part the game is focused on the main story -- that's not to say that no development occurs [i]during[/i] said main story, though: it certainly does, especially for the new characters.\nAlso, Sophie very cute.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is the game where you get to cruise around Japan with all of the homies from the vanilla Persona 5. In some ways, it's like Final Fantasy 15 but less brokey and more combat.\n\nThis game is incredibly similar to the original game when it comes to story structure. Unfortunately, this one manages to be even more predictable, but I still liked the story, even though it had some low-low moments. ( that bath scene was sad )\n\nUnfortunately, if you haven't played the original persona 5 or the royal version of it, you will not understand why these characters are important. In addition, you will, of course, receive spoilers for the original game.\n\nThe combat is fun, but you won't find DMC 5 levels of depth to it. That's fine, but the problem lies with the fact that, the combat becomes boring halfway through.\nMeaning that if the game was shorter it would fit better or if the game had more to its combat it would fit the length of the game better.\n\nThis PC port comes with a few problems that we've had since day one, the best example being the very first load screen.\nWhatever the reason, it takes a very long time to load in and sometimes it never happens.\n\n\nThis game is fine, but wait for a sale, also I highly recommend you stay away from it if you never played the original game.",

The combat feels like a fun departure from Persona's turn-based combat while still remaining true to staple mechanics like exploiting weaknesses, One More, and All Out Attacks.\n\nThe story is also very fun, and it's great getting to see all the characters interact with each other. The individual plots for each \"dungeon\" do feel a little samey so far, but that isn't enough to detract from the charm and amazing rapport the Phantom Thieves have with each other.",

        "content": "Anyone familiar with the Warriors games will have a rough understanding of what to expect. But this time around the Persona mechanics are integrated quite well, making it a very different experience than any Warriors game before it - if anything, the much larger number of enemies than normal for a Persona game necessitates a stronger focus on the weakness system in order to maintain an advantage. And yes, Persona collection and fusion are still core mechanics as well. Overall, it lends itself to using very different tactics than a normal Persona game, and combinations I wouldn't have really bothered with outside of this game. The story and cutscenes are completely faithful to what one would expect of Persona, and I felt were very fulfilling.\n\nThat being said, I will say the boss design is a bit weak - the major bosses do have unique mechanics and do feel unique, but the fights drag a bit and begin to feel stale with the amount of hp they have. The minor bosses don't have the benefit of unique mechanics to offset the hp-spongeness.",

I loved it.  \n\nThe game is lengthy.  The mechanics are fluid.  The integrated RPG elements are well done.  The story is great and its wonderful to have the Phantom thieves back together again for a second romp.  The writing is good.  \n\nExcessive chit chat can get a little tiring towards the end of the game.\n\nOverall excellent.",

The Persona elements they incorporate are neat, but not nearly enough to keep me engaged. I don't think it's a bad game so to speak, but I definitely regret paying full price for it.

However the genre this time is different which mostly reflects in combat, which has moved from classic turn-based style to ripping and tearing dozens of enemies at once. The game is as stylish as its predecessor, but not as complex and long. The characters we all know and love remain such through the whole playthrough. In addition we get two completely new companions, who are an excellent addition to the famous cast. Persona 5 Strikers is a roller coaster of emotions from start to finish. Definitely recommend this product to anyone who's familiar with the series and is open to some innovations.",

        "content": "P5S is a sequel/ spinoff of Persona 5, and its pretty good. The question I see about this game all the time is \"do I need to play Base Persona 5 to play this one?\" and yeah, I think you should. It takes place directly after, and while they don't touch on the story of P5 often, you still miss a lot of information on the characters and world, and if you go back to P5 later, a lot of stuff will be spoiled for you. Its not MANDITORY by any means, but enhances the game considerably. \n\nWith that out of the way, the game itself is a hack and slash game similar to the Warriors Series. And this is the first game with that combat I've consistently enjoyed. I've played Fire Emblem Warriors and Hyrule Warriors, and both of them get really REALLY boring after so many hours, but P5S keeps it fresh the whole way through, and is the only of this kind of game I've gone and 100%ed. The Demon Fusion elements from SMT are still present, but have been watered down considerably. This was a downside for me, but if you found the system tedious, this could be a good thing for you. Unless you're going for full completion, there is minimal grinding in this game, and the different ways to improve are all satisfying and fun to keep up with. The social aspect is all gone and the story is very streamlined, which makes it feel a lot less \"persona-y\" and the story is generally far more simple than anything else you'll see in this series, but the game never pretends to be more than it is. If you're coming for a simple button masher with some familiar faces and a cool world. you're in the right spot. But if you want a game that will make you feel the same way previous Persona games did, you're in the wrong spot. Overall if you liked P5 and want more. I'd recommend checking this one out. 6/10",

Romance, social links, mini-games? None here, bub.\n3. It's really a story that doesn't need to be told.\n4. The music is bumping.\n\nPersona 5 is great. But this extra filler? Even the most die hard fans I think will be semi-let down over it. For example, Sophia and Old Man Zenkichi are not very charming. Finally, it has some of the lame changes of heart ever... Including someone semi-copying other peoples manga tropes and adding them to his own stupid manga. I would advise you watch a YouTube for about an thirty minutes of gameplay just to see if it's for you.\n\n",

The game duration should be around 40-50 hours, but the story is really good and worth its attention. For casual players, it is recommended (specially if you played P5 vanilla) a lot of fun and the combat system is fair enough. Adding new characters that have good characterization and development. Something to add... the music is awesome. The new additions and the remastered versions of the old ones are just better. Anyway, long story short, the game has a good narrative, good game-play along with the awesome music, and amazing addition of new characters.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a wonderful continuation of the world of Persona 5. The characters maintain their growth and prove how memorable they are through dialogue, the story is a heartwarming romp across Japan, and the music keeps the funky flair mixed with newfound upbeat tempos and hard rock to hammer home the extremely hype show-stopping moments of the game. With a run time of 90-100 hours and then some for those who want even more, the price is well worth it if you are looking for a new action game to sink your free time into.\n\nHowever, the combination of classic Persona mechanics and action game speed, timing, and reflexes, along with some new innovations or streamlined bits, creates a super cool blend of worthwhile progression that is as addicting as it is semi-frustrating. You can only get better at the game by practicing your moments of striking while the iron is hot, but when ambushes effectively end encounters before they begin when the Phantom Thieves gain higher levels, sometimes there are points when you are just waiting to put your button skill and game knowledge to a real test. It is a minor grievance, but admittedly this was an issue on normal difficulty for me. I plan on trying out harder difficulties in the near future.\n\nOverall, this is a must have for Persona 5 fans, possibly Persona/Shin Megami Tensei fans in general who want an electrifying change of pace from the turn-based format that you're used to.",

        "content": "This is persona 5 light fused with a mus\u00f4. \n\nFirst, I would strongly recommend coming here after playing the original persona 5 or better persona 5 royal (even though in this case some elements would not be cannon with this story). First, it is a sequel / OVA so starting by the second entry is a bit silly, second a good half of the persona experience is your link with its cast of characters so, even if most of the mechanics of the story are re-explained, you would miss a lot a things, and persona 5 is one of the best games of last generation sooo...\n\nAnyway, presentation wise, exactly like its predecessor, this game is pristine, beautiful, inspired and varied environments, the music (again) is awesome, great animation works... It just radiates quality.\nSame thing in the writing department, the characters are as endearing as ever, and the additions to the thieves are very welcome, but the plot is a tad predictable sometimes.\nThe problem arises in the gameplay department, the moment-to-moment gameplay is clearly an experiment here, sometimes fighting can be tedious because of the stuck camera, lack of clarity, and the amount of enemies / time to dispatch them\u2026 when it\u2019s good it is really good you dodge and weave through the enemies with grace\u2026 until nothing shows you that another enemy is about to one shot from behind\u2026 Also, some jails (think palaces in p5) are a bit too big and revisiting them can be a bit tedious. The fusion system is a bit more tedious with level requirement for fusions components. And for the out of jail part, it is good, the confident system has been replaced by a much simpler system that allows you to unlock bonuses by collecting points doing requests (simple quests), after story event and during fighting, simpler but fitting for this much simpler game.\nAnyway, it is a quality game with some gameplay inconsistencies, though even though it is less good than its mainline entry, I enjoyed it a great deal and if you liked p5 you should too! Though I would really love to see another iteration on these mechanics, a p6s maybe? \nAnyway, it\u2019s time for you to tear your mask out, right?",

That being said even if you haven't had the chance to play the original because its not on pc, this game still stands on its own as a fun game with a compelling story. For a 3D hack and slash style game P5S is middle of the road in terms its combat. The music is amazing with some new music mixed with remixes of some tracks from the original game. This game does however lack a lot of real challenge. If you are someone looking for a game that will challenge you this is probably not a game for you.",

        "content": "If you liked Persona 5 this game is quite a good sequel.  (Playing this without playing Persona 5 will leave you utterly lost though so go play Persona 5 now) \n\nComparatively, you get another 3/4 of a game of Persona 5 story and character interaction.  You get another new 3/4 of a excellent Persona 5 soundtrack and some arranged returning tracks.  All the new battle music is amazing as usual.  Voice acting is top notch.  No social links and the persona and fusion lineup is pared down, but it's no big deal.  \n\nGameplay is decent.  It's a Musou game by the Dynasty Warriors people but does not feel swarmy or button mashy most of the time.  Even on normal difficulty not paying attention to the enemy movements and resistances will get you killed as enemies can hit like trucks.  There's more focus on killing large minibosses over swarms of enemies.  And the big bosses are pretty fun.",

        "content": "Just about everything I loved about both Personas 5 and Royal is transplanted into Strikers. The charming characters, the story, the vibrant menus, and the music combine with a new combat system that disposes of turn-based, RPG-style fighting in favor of a more frenetic, real-time, one vs. 1,000 format that still makes you feel like you\u2019re playing a Persona game.\n\nPut the Phantom Thieves in damn near anything, and I\u2019ll show up. They\u2019re so well-written, realistic-sounding and mature. And they\u2019ve grown from when we last met them, showing empathy to their adversaries. You\u2019ll cheer when they get their big damn hero moment. How could I not take the opportunity to spend another 100 hours with these kids? And on a cross-Japan road trip too? Say less.\n\nIt\u2019s almost unfair to call Strikers a musou game, despite being one, as it doesn\u2019t feel like a Dynasty Warriors game at all. For as much as I love Koei Tecmo\u2019s tentpole action series, Strikers\u2019 combat is too slick and too varied, and too stylistically Persona to be called a typical musou. And I think it\u2019s that combat that saves an otherwise sparsely appointed game.",

        "content": "TLDR: I don't like the gameplay loop, its too boring and redundant, but I like scenes where the gang hanging out and once the new story start rolling. There's something lacking on the gameplay loop, I find it hard to gather motivation to comeback to this game.\n\nI'm a huge Persona fans so I'm a bit sad I can't like this game, I tried to push the end because I want to see what's the story had to offer. This is not a bad game, its a decent game but I need to push my self to finish it unlike other Persona games.\n\n[h2]Good story and Character[/h2]\nOne of the good aspect in this game is the story, it's not as good as P5 Royal's third semester but it's an enjoyable story. It started with formulaic story but after the monotonous story done, it's an enjoyable story. The new cast on this game is the highlight of this game, his story is good and enjoyable, it had soul and might touch your heart. I really enjoy his story.\n\n[h2]Great Music[/h2]\nI like the soundtrack of this game, my favorite one is \"Daredevil\" and \"Counter Strike\". This game had really good music like you would expect from any persona games. The music gives so much vibe in this game, for example the \"Daredevil\" is feel like \"I'm stylishly unstoppable\" when striking toward towers and \"Counter Strike\" feel like \"a smooth badass\". It's pretty good\n\n[h2]This is a decent game for returning fans, but its not a good game for new comers[/h2]\nThis game contains every team member already finished their character development on P5 so there's no many growth worth mentioning, many stuff in this game will appeal to the fans but might confuse new comer.\n\n[h2] There's a good mechanic, but gameplay wise, I can't say many good thing about it[/h2]\nThere's a good mechanic like allowing you to swap to previously learned skill on your persona and cooking. I'm a huge Persona fans and find this entry quite underwhelming. It's still feel like Persona 5, character and story wise its good but gameplay wise is meh.\n\n[h2]SP & HP management is bad in this game[/h2]\nOne of the most fun challange in Persona game is HP and SP management and this spin off made it a nuisance. On the original game, you need to manage your resource efficiently, if you fail to do so you'll lost 1 day worth of free time it's a pretty clever mechanic. On this spin off there's no penalty, to recover your resource just simply go out and go to dungeon again while doing it you need to watch 3 loading screen, it's such a pain to do. This game should've had 1 button to recover HP & SP instead of doing that stupid clunky way.\n\n[h2]Decent UI, bad UX[/h2]\nI hate the UX in this game. The UI is decent but the UX is bad. The most obvious thing is unskippable transition, it such a spit in the face to the original P5 UX. To do something you need to watch TRANSITION, it's unskipable and slow it makes doing everything in the main menu feel sluggish, I hate it. It's so bad compared to P5 which is very concise, stylish, responsive, fast and clearly designed with player in mind. Pretty sure the designer in this game should learn from Masayoshi Sutoh and Hisayoshi Kijima (the UI designer of Persona 5 and Nier: Automata).\n\n[h2]Stripped Velvet Room[/h2]\nThe velvet room is a stripped down version of the original, I don't like it. It feels limited and it lacks the charm of the velvet room.\n\n[h2]The Persona skill is not well designed and battle is a bit mindless[/h2]\nA simple case: \"maragi\" previously it used to attack fire to all enemy in front of you, this lead to many interesting decision like:\n[list]\n[*] \"should I save sp or damage everyone with fire?\"\n[*] \"there's a deamon that drain fire, is it worth to attack everything but some of them gain health?\"\n[*] \"there's a deamon that reflect fire, is it worth to attack everything but I take damage?\"\n[*] \"should I finish this battle in 1 turn or wait for the next few turn?\"\n[*] etc\n[/list]\nBut in this game, maragi just simply attack wider range. It doesn't effect anything, there's no interesting decision its just a mindless skill. This not only happen to maragi skill but happen to buff/debuff and the gambling hama skill. The battle on this game is a bit mindless, I'm not saying P5 is hard but it had many interesting decision during its battle and I feel there's no such decision being made while I play this game.\n\n[h2]Conslusion[/h2]\nIf you like persona games, I would bet you'll like the story of this game. If you really want to know what's happen, go a head and play it. I don't like the gameplay and if you can't stand mindless gameplay and nuisance that I mentioned above, IMO its not worth it to push through it and better with watching youtube gameplay.\n\n[h2]Final Score: 2/5[/h2]",

        "content": "I love persona 5, I was happy that this game had a continuation. I have extreme bias on this game, because Persona 5 is definitely my favorite game of all times. There is so much fun tidbits that makes the cast and humor funny. I love the characters, writing, and visuals. The styles and humor makes the whole game colorful for me. I hope Persona 5 royal will come out on PC someday. This game felt like a little fanservice that touched my heart after Persona 5 Royal. Please keep up the great work developers!",

Everything is where it needs to be in order to sell a game people play and, at the end of their session, say \"wow, that was a unique and interesting game\" without actually paying it any mind. The reality of the situation, however, is a bit more grim.\n\nWe should start by giving this game kudos for TRYING to implement mouse and Keyboard support. For a W-Force product to do this, you know someone else was involved forcing it to happen. No, on to the short and sweet as to why I would not recommend this game:\n\n[b] Replayability is almost nonexistent [/b]\n\nThere's not much more to say. You are trapped in a linear storyline with horribly restrictive and boring free-roam [b] elements. [/b] Outside of that, it is just you doing missions with a main character who, while wildly loved by the series' respective fans, is not the reason people play Warrior games. To have a single-digit number of characters that can be played, and only after some time, in a title like this is embarrassing and really highlights the shortcomings of the rest of the game.\n\n[b] Artistic style is not an excuse for fun. [/b]\n\nAt the end of the day, a fresh coat of paint isn't an excuse for a lack of content. It looks very pretty, yes. True to the series for artistic choice? Yes. Does it add anything else? No. It seems the majority of production on this game went into pressing out another story in the Persona Universe without actually making the game around the new action-based mechanics.\n\nDon't get it unless you merely want to continue the Persona fandom.",

The gameplay is fun and all the characters feel distinct enough, on the harder difficulties you have to think about what skills to use and when which adds a layer of complexity to the gameplay.\nThe plot is nothing spectacular but it's good enough to make you want to play through the whole game.",

It is by no means easier either, as the game can be insanely difficult even on Normal mode, making Hard mode almost impossible to complete. Without doing extra side stuff like requests, or secret bosses the game might only take about 20 hours to complete, which my play-through with doing those things (plus some save scumming for specific side objectives) i finished the game at around 35 hours, which is not reflected in my Steam playtime as I was alt-tabbed out of the game a lot. I've not played many Musou games (only two being both Hyrule Warriors spin-offs as well) but for a crowd fighting game it's really weird the most you'll fight at a time is 3-15 enemies, with bigger crowds only available in scripted events, filled with generic no weakness enemies.",

I would prefer to give this a mixed review over a negative review, but people only read the negative reviews.\n\nIf you're buying this, then you have probably already played P5/P5R (and if you haven't, there's really nothing here for you). It's pretty much just a lot of fan service tied together with an okay story, which is fine if that's what you're looking for. The gameplay loop is novel at first if you're coming from the slow, turnbased combat of the mainline games, but gets very boring and repetitive towards the later half of the game. I used Cheat Engine to get more XP and lowered the difficulty because the game expects you to grind to level up all your characters even on the lowest difficulty, which is frankly silly. \n\nThe fanservice is enjoyable, but they cheaped out on a lot of the smaller interactions. For example, in mainline Persona 5, if you ate ramen with Ryuji in your free time, there'd be at least some action-figure-like animations accompanying you eating ramen. In this game, it just gives you a black screen with Ryuji telling you how delicious the ramen is. It's not great, but this is only for the minor interactions and nothing else really reaches that level of laziness.\n\nThat said, if you understand this is just a spinoff with none of the major Persona mechanics and just want to have more time with the Phantom Thieves, this might be worth it- on sale.",

        "content": "The first Persona game I have played was 5.  it was fun at first but as you go you realize every enemy fights the exact same and every single battle is the exact same tactic.  Tactic, strategy what ever you want to call your plan in battle is the exact same every fight, hold R1 to find a weakness on an enemy to get an \"all out attack\" to build your special, or \"showtime\" meter.  I cant finish the game because it became so mundane and endless talking and cutscene's.  Every time you encounter an enemy they have to talk to you first then change their form into what you'll fight, which is also confusing why they all have one form to speak and one to fight in.  \n\nI think these games are over hyped and end up long over staying their welcome.  If it had an intelligent combat system and intuitive and changing enemy types it would be far more engaging.  Not for me personally.  I'll stick to the God of Wars when i need some melee story telling exerperience and you should save your money and not get this dull game.  Having forced myself to attempt to finish this game I'm calling it quits at 44 hours in.  Use me as a lesson and not your wallet.",

Never would have imagined that my wish would come true!\n\nWell, sort of, at least. Story-wise, [i]Persona 5 Strikers[/i] is indeed a sequel (although most of the side characters from [i]P5[/i] are absent, and don\u2019t expect to develop/continue any romantic relationships, either), however, the battle system is quite different this time around. I, for one, wasn\u2019t a huge fan of this new, active, real-time combat. Sure, you can get used to it pretty fast, it\u2019s not very difficult, controls are pretty fluid, and it can definitely be fun obliterating huge hordes of enemies \u2013 it\u2019s just that I, personally, have always preferred turn-based battles in JRPGs. \n\nAs for the other aspects of the game, there\u2019s nothing I could complain about. The visuals are absolutely gorgeous, including all the beautiful anime cutscenes, the story is meaningful (although maybe a bit weaker than in [i]P5[/i]) filled with relatable characters, and the music\u2026 God, I loved the music, just like in all [i]Persona[/i] games I\u2019ve played so far! Admittedly, most of the songs are from [i]P5[/i], but I didn\u2019t mind that at all. I\u2019m telling you, the soundtracks of these games are incredible.\n\nAll in all, even if you\u2019re like me and are a bit intimidated by the battle system, I think you should give this one a try. There are less social interactions than in [i]P5[/i], no minigames, less characters, but in exchange, you get more cities to explore, [spoiler]and even some new Phantom Thieves![/spoiler]",

Need to make every attacks and dodges counts XD, utilizing the right personas also part of the strategies in order to beat even the tutorial battle (that pixie one shotted me, yikes.. reminds me of SMT nocturne's tutorial on hard difficulty)\nso this game is still fun to beat more than one playthough\n\nthe story itself is good and the environment is good too(feels like you actually visit the place, like playing YAKUZA games), but unfortunately for player who played the original P5 game, the plot is predictable and pretty similar.\n\nOld review:\nThis game is fun, but the only reason I gave dislike review is because this game CRASHED a LOT between the loading screen or some random events.\nI have to constantly save in every occasions just to make sure I can continue safely, especially on the end game when leveling our chara/personas, it was very frustating when I forgot to save and then I have to farm/do some quest again.\n\nI will change my review when they fixed this issue tho",

        "content": "Calling this game a spinoff of Persona 5 would be a disservice. Despite a huge difference in gameplay Persona 5 Strikers feels more like a proper sequel. Not only that but I can wholeheartedly say that I had more fun with P5S than with the vanilla Persona 5.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers, at its core, is a Musou type game with Persona mechanics. Meaning, a hack'n'slash with hundreds of enemies and some RPG elements. And surprisingly such combination works very well. The production values are quite impressive, with a brand new story reuniting the Phantom Thieves together, as well as introducing some well-developed new characters. The way the characters interact feels like a proper Persona game, and while the core story isn't anything groundbreaking, it is still very well presented, with some nice twists here and there. Honestly, I think I enjoyed the story more than the vanilla Persona 5, mainly because the characters we interact with are not just simple one-dimensional villains like in the original.\n\nDespite lacking the social-life aspect of previous Persona titles, many other elements unique to that series are present in Strikers. And the action-oriented gameplay works very well with them. Kind of brings back memories of the Devil Summoner series from the PS2, only better and even more dynamic. With several different playable and customizable characters, as well as dozens of Personas to fuse for the main character, the hack'n'slash gameplay doesn't get tedious too fast. Mashing buttons won't get you far, as there's still a need to be tactical and aware of enemies' affinities. That said, even though I'm no action game expert, I've found the controls to be very intuitive and comfortable. Rarely had any issues controling the characters or running around the environment.\n\nThe game looks and sounds great. The style is very similar to Persona 5, and the new music is very catchy, whether in battle, dungeons, or during free-time. Environments are numerous and varied. This goes for both the dungeons and the Japanese cities the party visits during their trip.\nThe game runs at 60fps and the PC port is honestly surprisingly good. Never had a single technical issue and the game ran very smoothly with no frame drops whatsoever.\n\nWhereas the original Persona 5, for me, got tedious very fast, I've found Persona 5 Strikers way more enjoyable. To the point I've started the New Game + on the highest difficulty only to appreciate it even more. Sure, there are some flaws, obviously, but my point is that the game is really good and every fan of Persona 5 should give it a try. Other people maybe not so much, mainly because Strikers is a direct sequel to Persona 5, which I'd suggest either play or watch beforehand.\n\nOverall, a great game that doesn't deserve to be called a spinoff, because it's much more than that. I've had tons of FUN with Strikers and I'm pretty sure I'll replay it again someday.",

        "content": "Great music as always, with classic remixes and top tier new tracks. Story is a little better than expected out of a spinoff game, though the fact there are no mentions of Royal content whatsoever is disappointing. The core gameplay is actually really fun and not as much of a deviation from traditional combat as you'd think, and it really highlights how cool the Phantom Thieves are meant to look when moving and fighting simultaneously as a team. The Personas available feel very limiting (especially the late game ones) but fusion is relatively in depth and fun to play with. The \"real life\" exploration is also constricted but the different settings the game takes place in are charming and nice to have to make the game feel more like a mainline title.\n\nMy only major complaint is the crashing, which is a complete pain in the ass in a game without autosave. Save often! Other than that, there are only a few small annoying issues, such as shop items having incredibly low stock, money being a major bottleneck even after 80 hours + full completion, way too many BOND skills, and Persona stat changes feeling useless.\nOverall, P5S is a fun game that Persona 5 fans will almost certainly have fun with.",

Rather than being the typical turn based it is all real time. My complaint about this system is that there isn\u2019t much variety in the move sets. The story is overall pretty good, not the best but still very enjoyable. The OST is S tier per usual when it comes to a persona game with some twists on some of the classic Persona 5 songs giving them some extra flair and energy that felt much needed for a musou game. In one of the dungeons I did experience a really bad bug, which caused the game to freeze a ton. It did hinder my enjoyment in the game and I do hope it was fixed. Other than that, I believe it to be a solid game",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is an interesting mix of Persona 5 story, characters and lore with the typical Dynasty Warriors gameplay (haven't played any dynasty warriors yet). Whether you like this game or not will depend on what you liked in Persona 5 more, which is either the life-sim/story or the gameplay or both. \n\nAlso btw, this is a full-on sequel to Persona 5 (not Royal) so I would highly recommend playing that one first. Not just because it gives you more insight into the characters but it is also a better put together game, albeit with its weaknesses which P5S has seemed to borrowed over as well.\n\nIt is definitely a game made for people who have played and fell in love with Persona 5 before. Great music, great characters (new ones too) with an interesting amalgamation of both the combat styles, but highly leaning towards the use of Personas in the active battlefield. I was no longer waiting 120 seconds per turn to think about my next 3 moves, like what I would do in Persona 5. Now you have to make split second decisions, but you can always open up the persona menu mid-battle to pause time and think about your strategy a bit. Some levels are poorly balanced so feel free to adjust the difficulty if you retry more than twice on a mission, unless you are in it for the challenge.\n\n1. My biggest problem with this game is the same problem that I had with P5.\n\nThe story and the pace of it is just too slow at some points especially in the middle, where you feel like the story is not progressing anywhere and we are basically waiting for something to happen/give us a clue. Some dungeons are just too big, and they throw the same enemy types at you and you steamroll through them till you reach a boss which spices up some things but largely uses the same skills, tactics etc. Lots of potential here to make you feel burned out and bored if you figure out some strategies which work in the short term.\n\n2. My second biggest problem, I don't think the game puts enough emphasis on using persona skills that automatically trigger when you execute a particular combo. This is especially helpful with Joker since he is the most versatile one and using the skills in combos drains 0 SP, so you still get some chance to retaliate at low SP. It's basically a weakened version of a skill but takes no SP. SP is still a rarely found resource in the game and especially when there is no checkpoints to save your progress and refresh your SP in sight.\n\n3. Third, I feel the story and dungeons were too repetitive and simplistic this time. The story repeated itself for 3-4 dungeons (these were the long ones too imo). Go to the dungeon, chase the red marker, kill everything that stands in your way. I saw this in P5 as well so I think it carried on from there but the most complex things that the dungeon crawling in P5 and P5S require from you are simple yet gloried fetch quests. I would have liked to see the dungeon crawling requires at least 10% of my brain power to clear through them.\n\n4. This point is deriving info heavily from the P5 story so most of this is in spoiler territory. [spoiler]The plot lacks originality. The story is pretty similar to P5 (the characters say that they have seen this happen themselves). The bosses have more backstory this time so that's nice but still it seems pretty formulaic by the time the story tries to create suspense because the pacing issues I mentioned up there. Zenkichi and Sophia are welcome additions to the crew however. I think Zenkichi's addition should have happened sooner that it did because the plot picks up after that point quickly. The pacing issues is something I really hope ATLUS improves on because plenty of people just leave games when they get boring or some people just stop paying attention to the stuff going on (like me during the mid-game).[/spoiler]\n\nEven after all my criticisms, I feel this game deserves a genuine try by Persona fans because there's still plenty of things to love here, especially Persona 5 fans like me. I think I just bought this game for the UI as soon as it came it out :P",

Makes the game a cakewalk.\n\nOn the other hand, I really miss the risk factor of having to take a combat turn to eat and get my health back up.\n\n\n\nAlso, on the topic of technical issues, the Steam version has worked just fine on my PC for 80+ hours, so I think they fixed whatever was giving people trouble before.",

But that's once the massive influx of bugs gets fixed.\nRandom crashes every two or three loading screens, black screen on cutscenes, infinite load times, controllers suddenly making constant 360's on the camera, and audio breaks are some of the most common bugs the game is experiencing as of 23/02/2021.\nMy review will almost surely change once I get to play more than 30 minutes without it crashing into desktop, but as of now, it stands in the negative.\nTo anyone thinking about buying the game, please make sure the bugs are mostly dealt with before doing so.\n\nEDIT: Yeah, they fixed almost all bugs, took them around two months after launch to do it, but they fixed them.\n\nGame's good, it feels like an OVA of the original P5. They flesh out the team members a little bit more, and they again reinforce with strength that Ryuji is -in fact- the goodest boy.\nMechanics-wise, they managed to be as faithful to the original as much as the musou format allowed them, which is amazing given the vast difference between gameplays.\nThe game kinda becomes weaker story-wise the more it gets closer to the end, but it's fair to assume it's still got passing grades on this regard.\nIt's a pretty good game overall. \nA shame the post-game doesn't have too much to fiddle around once you beat it, but it's a good buy.",

        "content": "Another amazing addition to the Persona series, wouldn't say its as good as Persona 5 (Royal and Vanilla) as the confidant aspect was a hugely important part of the games but I do like the bond mechanic too! The combat, while different, is very fun with the different ways of fighting and a good way to adapt a tradition JRPG to a more action-based combat system. I'm not too far into the story but I think it has done well to incorporate aspects of real everyday life with EMMA being similar to other tech in the real world. Can't wait to play more and would 100% recommend it to anyone (though I'd suggest playing Persona 5 first because there are things you need to play/watch the prequel to understand)\n\nEdit 1: Finished the second jail and came to say that I LOVE the story, taking the persona 5 characters and placing them in positions that mirror their past selves is ingenious because it shows how the characters could have ended up before finding their real resolve from the main character and how they react to those going through a similar fate.",

The music rocks, the gameplay is surprisingly engaging and somewhat difficult. The style helps encapsulate a feeling of badass combat. And the story is fun, nothing mind blowing from what I've played, but it doesn't have to be, it knows what it wants to be, and I think it achieves what it sets out to do very well. If you like P5 and fast based combat and exploration, get this game, it's just more time with your favorite characters with a new gameplay style that kicks ass!\n\n*Update* I think most of what I said before stays true after finishing the game, my only new statement is that I think the game lasts a bit too long for a sequel spin off, and that the new characters sell the story the most out of everyone in the cast. I still recommend this game",

These are no secret and you can easily find lots of reports and people asking for solutions on game own forums. Developer keeps releasing \"beta\" hotfixes, none of which fixed issues for me.\n\nI am not sure if these issues have something to do with poor support for AMD CPUs, generally poor multithreading stability (some fixes suggest issues with hyperthreading) or some issues with Denuvo DRM uses.\n\nAlso keep in mind these bugs tend to happen most on late game levels, at time where you are well past return window. I wonder if developer deliberately spent most time polishing start of the game to avoid refunds.\n\nEdit: After 13 additional hours, Steam suggested \"do you want to revise your review\".\nWell, I still don't recommend it. I managed to get through buggy stages, but it was super-frustrating, I had to redo couple very difficult boss fights when game decided to freeze on me.\n\nI somehow managed to get through by a lot of manual hacks by playing with CPU affinity, and later actually using Visual Studio debugger to un-stick the frozen game (having programmer background helped). Still I feel this was way above what average user can or should be able to deal with, so \"Not recommended\" verdict still stays.",

Had a blast listening to the BG music while playing.\n     > The devs took the opportunity to flesh out some of the underdeveloped characters in P5/P5R and generally succeeded. The cast now feels more well-rounded.\n     > Road-tripping through Japan as the setting was great as I was familiar with several of the places the Phantom Thieves visited and it reminded me of how much I enjoyed my own trips.\n     [spoiler]> The devs did a helluva job in introducing and establishing the new Phantom Thieves Wolf and Sophie as relatable characters. Sophie in particular reminded me a lot of Vivi from FFIX in that her journey of learning and growth was also central to the story.[/spoiler]\n\n[h1]Things I'm meh about or disliked:[/h1]\n     > The combat mechanics were just ok for me. I settled into them more or less by halfway through the game but boss fights more or less devolved to P5-style of fighting - buff, spam elemental weakness, toss items around like crazy. Gimme the old turn-based combat any day.\n     > The slice of life stuff that really drew me into P5R felt lacking here. As mentioned previously, I wish the game leaned more into that especially since the original premise of P5 was supposedly a big jaunt around the world which Strikers is delivering on a smaller scale.\n     [spoiler]> The post-Kyoto storyline devolving into a retread of P5 was kinda disappointing. Konoe as Shido-adjace (even down to the boss fight mechanics), Demiurge being character-wise a repeat of Yaldabaoth, and the final 2 jails being Mementos-adjace left me a little let down by the final 3 or so hours of the game.[/spoiler]\n\n[h1]Overall: A good, almost-great sequel to P5.[/h1]",

        "content": "While I do think the game is very good, the combat isn't as great as you might think. Most battles on higher difficulties turn into you spamming SP because there's no way in hell you're beating some of these bosses otherwise. Stronger moves cost a large amount of SP, unless you have certain Persona abilities. Be ready to chug sodas or other SP restoration items. I definitely advise playing on easy so the combat doesn't start to drag and bosses don't take a long time. The combo versions of spells just don't cut it.  At all. You'll either get knocked out of it or get it off and deal basically no damage. Combat basically comes down to this cycle: heat riser -> apply status -> spam technicals and/or weakness -> recover SP. I've tried several times to play the game any other way and the payoff is never worth it. The moment I got Spell Master, the other party members might as just not exist. \n\nOkay, now that the bummer part is out of the way. The story is great! The new characters fit in perfectly and I want more of them. The old cast bounce off of each other and the new characters very well! The music is incredible and a lot of boss designs and set pieces are really good. \n\nThe quality of life for Persona abilities is great and definitely should be added to the main games going forward. Merciless drops items that increase a stat by 1 so other party members can achieve 99 in all stats, which is pretty satisfying. Fusion is a little lack luster, requiring some persona to be very high leveled and there's just not that many to fuse. Persona take forever to level, and using the persona points system is really tedious. You essentially buy and release the same persona over and over to get more persona points. The ultimate persona is just Lucifer, which is a bummer given the potential of P5's ultimate Persona in this game.\n\nYou probably won't encounter these issues unless you play on hard or normal, and you'll definitely avoid most of the fusion issues if you aren't achievement hunting like I was. If you like Persona 5, you'll like this game. Simple as that.",

Despite that, I was more than willing to try it out cuz P5 is THAT good (already played that game on PS4).\n\nMuch to my pleasant surprise, the story is obviously a continuation of the events of P5 and I love that! I'm always down to get more of the amazing characters. And this game introduces some new and awesome characters too!\n\nThe combat also surprisingly works REALLY well! The hack and slach feels satisfying and the mob density in some fights is really good!\n\nA quick note - Don't forget to save MANUALLY. Its been a while since I played P5 and I totally forgot I have to save manually lol. Don't think this game has auto saves at all. So, keep saving! I lost like 3-4 hours of progress cuz I was gaming late at night and forgot to save before I hit the sack.\n\nOverall a easy 8/10 for neutrals.. and a 9/10 if you are a Persona fan (like me)!",

        "content": "Ahh, Persona 5 Strikers, I've been wanting to get my hands on you for awhile, and now that I have, I can finally write a review. Now, I highly recommend you at the very least watch a playthrough of the original Persona 5 (Or Persona 5 Royal) first before picking this game up, as it's a direct sequel to Persona 5. I won't be covering the story of Strikers much in this review either.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers takes place after the events of Persona 5, you once again play as Joker, as you and the rest of the Phantom Thieves travel around Japan for the Summer. That's pretty much the premise.\n\nThe gameplay is very different from the mainline games, Persona 5 Strikers is a Hack and Slash with RPG elements. The gameplay itself I found quite fun, and I definitely found a few of the battles a bit challenging, even on normal difficulty. \n\nOne of my favorite parts gameplay-wise is that I never ever felt the need to grind for experience. I never felt too underleveled or too overleveled. The game also reintroduces Persona fusion. And while not as vast as the mainline games, it was still quite robust and intuitive. Dare i say, some aspects of the fusion I liked more compared to Persona 5. \n\nWithout getting into it, the story was really good, on-par with most persona games. I found myself invested in not only the characters i'm familiar with, but also the newly introduced ones. And there were a lot of moments that made me visibly happy, sad, angry, and so on. And that's a sign that they did something right.\n\nContent-wise, this game has quite a bit. It only took me roughly 40 hours to beat from start to finish over the course of four days, then again I played it practically nonstop when I bought it. I'm a bit of a Persona fanboy, haha. \n\nI do also plan on completing this game 100%, definitely. This game has quite a lot you can do in it, even in post-game you still got some stuff left.\n\nThe english voice acting was fantastic. I plan to play the game again in Japanese to compare, but I just LOVE the english voice cast so much, some of the deliveries were on point, and I laughed out loud quite a bit at many lines.\n\nOf course, I can't talk about a Persona game without addressing the best part about the series. The music.\n\nGood GOD the music. It's fantastic! The music is a LOT more fast paced compared to the mainline games. All the battle tracks get me absolutely hyped to fight. And the remixes of songs like Last Surprise and Rivers in the Desert, among others, were done amazingly well! I could listen to each track for hours and NEVER get tired of it! \n\nI did yoink the deluxe edition though, which means I got two DLCs along with the base game! So I'll cover that next.\n\nThe first DLC was the all-out attack pack, it gives you a bunch of skill cards, along with 10,000 Persona points you can use to level personas up. The skills cards were nice, but also a bit unnecessary since the game is quite generous with it's skill cards, doesn't really justify the need for the price tag. \n\nThere's also the BGM DLC, it adds tracks from various persona mainline games. In my opinion, this is the better DLC option of the two. Changing the BGM can help change battles up a bit, and the fact that they remixed the battle theme from Revelations: Persona just for this game says a lot to me.\n\nThe Deluxe edition also came with bonus content on the side! Such as the soundtrack, a digital art book, and Behind-the-scenes footage! Which I find really cool! Watching the footage gives you a glimpse as to how much passion went into the game, and I enjoyed watching it!\n\nNow that all that's been said, let's get into the issues I had with this game, it's mainly bugs and small issues though.\n\nOne of the biggest things i experienced was audio issues, in-game audio was cutting in and out, along with crackling and stuttering. This is most apparent when I went to shop for things and bought things over and over in quick succession, or when I was in a menu like the compendium and scrolling down from the top to the bottom really quickly. This also happens in animated cutscenes, which kind of breaks the flow of everything, unfortunately. It never happened that often during normal gameplay, but it was often enough to the point that it ended up being really distracting, Although it was extremely rare, the game would also crash, which definitely was a bit frustrating when it did happen. A smaller thing was various instances of voiced dialogue not matching the text box, and lastly, audio balancing with the english voices. Sometimes the english voice acting is hard to understand, they sound too quiet, even had to turn the music down so i could hear the voice acting. This was mostly apparent with soft spoken voices. I'm not too mad at the audio balancing though, since they were recorded during a global pandemic, so that's something I can let go. That's pretty much it with my issues. \n\nAll in all, if you don't wanna deal with the audio issues and rare crashes, then I recommend getting the PS4 version, as it's probably the best version of the game. But if you don't mind the issues and want the convenience of having it on your PC, or you don't have a PS4 or Switch, then get this version, it's still worth it! The game is not only a fantastic one, but it's also a fairly stable port! I didn't ever have any problems with framerate either, which is a plus! This game receives a 9/10 from me!",

        "content": "Going into P5S I was expecting to suffer through what I've found to be typically uninteresting and monotonous Warriors-type gameplay for the sake of seeing the next part of the Persona crew's story, I came away pleasantly surprised, with not just my expectations challenged, but my skills as well.\n\nFor a Musou this is a surprising in-depth game, and it's really remarkable how much painstaking effort went into making it as P5 as possible. In fact, if I had to complain it's almost too similar to P5. This is true for gameplay, atmosphere, and even story--it hits many of the same beats, including a couple of the more tiresome ones. It does a great job expanding upon a few of the characters, most notably Haru and Makoto, while also introducing an excellent newcomer in the form of Zenkichi.\n\nSome characters don't get much spotlight, unfortunately, like Ryuji and Mona, and I lament that the development of this game coincided with that of P5 Royal, so none of the excellent additions therein with Kasumi, Akechi, and Maruki are present. And though I really liked the presentation of the Persona roadtrip, less is ultimately developed by this story than I would have liked. It goes places, but in a self-contained way, sort of like some anime movies. Still, it's a solid experience, and if you enjoyed base P5, you'd probably be missing out if you skipped this",

The story is great and entertaining, but the combat is just a mess. A lot of what makes Persona great (turn based combat, social links, etc.) does not exists in this game, such a disappointment. I would recommend this game if it was not a Persona game, too bad it is.\n\nThe good:\n - Entertaining and heartwarming story\n - The phantom thieves are back!\n - Combat is fun, if it is not a Persona game\n - Get to visit various places all over Japan\n\nThe bad:\n - Combat does not mix well with Persona elements\n - No social links in a Persona Game?",

        "content": "Having played and 100% Persona 5 originally, I was quite excited to get back into the world of Persona 5. The OST, group, and overall atmosphere was something I really enjoyed. With Persona 5 Strikers coming, I was looking forward to catching up with the Phantom Thieves. Seeing the characters and the world yet again felt a burst of memories from the original title. This game mixes up its gameplay with introducing a more Dynasty Warriors feel (well, it's made by the developers). So the game is HEAVY on the mobs of enemies you face with each character having their own personal combos/moves to perform in combat. The \"Palace\" aspect for the dungeons has been changed (won't say for spoiler sake), but it's more or less the same format. \n\nComing up on my personal opinion of the game being halfway through, it's kinda... meh? It's not a bad thing in no way, but the game does tend to just be rinse and repeat constantly. Gameplay is good enough to continue playing, but the story just kinda wanes as it goes by. If you're someone who wanted to wait for a sale, I say do so. You're not gaining or losing anything from playing/not playing the game. It's just more Persona 5. If that's what you've been yearning for, you won't be disappointed in that regard. The OST is great as usual for a Persona game. My overall first impressions of everything are fairly solid. Regardless, if you played the original Persona 5/Royal and have missed the Phantom Thieves, then this is definitely that game to scratch that itch.",

        "content": "An enjoyable sequel to Persona 5. You REALLY should play through the original/royal before diving into this one as its a follow on from the main storyline of that game. That said it does NOT follow on from Royal's extra 3rd semester content so if you have gotten to the 3rd semester that does not apply here as this game was made at the same time as Royal. Albeit as of the time of making this review neither the original or Royal have been ported to PC yet so you will have to wait if you are PC only and pray that Atlus does port it after the success from Persona 4 golden's port. Personally i played through both on PS4 (Combined total hours of over 230 for Persona 5 and Royal, Yes i love that game so much i played through it twice despite its monstrous length).  Took me a little bit of time (about half way through the first jail)  to fully get used to the Musou style of gameplay as this is my first game of that type of playstyle but once i got into it its great stuff, The mixture of persona and that style of gameplay blends well in my opinion. Storyline is good for the most part (some parts may feel a little bit lacking but its still a good game) and there's a mixture of sizes for the jails. 4 are Longer more fleshed out ones while the other 4 are shorter and in some cases much shorter mostly for some storyline purposes. Kyoto's jail makes up for its length with a great ending boss fight though its a shame you can't refight it like the others. While some of the shorter jails are a little disappointing length wise this did not hinder my overall enjoyment of the game and its nice to have a persona game that isn't so insanely long. Albeit this game still has good length and it did take me some time to finish all the requests and main story etc and post game content as i like to take my time with games. Music as usual when it comes to persona games is fantastic and the game looks decent in a higher resolution.  In summary if you enjoyed the original Persona 5/Royal and can adjust to the Musou style over the usual turn based combat this is more goodness for you with the gang you have come to love.",

I.E. you can set controls for when you are in battle, but if you want to use that same button in the \"normal world\" you CANT. The game will unmap the button from when you are fighting.\n\nThis practically forces you to use the default keybindings, which suck so much that the game is borderline unplayable.\n\n\n\n[b]The music[/b]\nWhat for me was a BIG reason why i finished P5R was the incredible music. Sure there were a few bad songs, think about mementos and okumura's palace, but mostly, the OST was great! Now in P5S the difference between good songs and bad songs is amplified. There are a few absolute bangers like daredevil, the intro, and the remix of last surprise. But sadly, at least three of the songs that i had really wished that would've been gone remain. (Tension, Blood of Villain, High Pressure (seriously, fuck this song))\n\nOverall for the music, 8/10. Some songs are bangers, some i wish they would've replaced.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nAs WarOwl would say, [i]it doesn't wooooork[/i]. From the boss fights with dialogue that you CANNOT focus on because the battles are now in real time instead of turn based which WILL make you miss story, to you being able to fully heal with no penalty whatsoever just by returning to the overworld and going back and the general clunky controls of some of your abilities... yeah, it doesn't work.\n\nClunky controls and poor game design choices. Yikes.\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nYes i realize that i've barely played the game and that i'm nowhere near finishing it, but from what i'm seeing right now, this is not good. Unengaging, boring and plot-hole filled storytelling that does not address any of what happened during P5/P5R. Not for me.\n\nIt's short enough that you should just read it.\nPlease do tell me if the story gets better after the first palace, cause if it doesn't i don't think i'll finish the game.\n\n\nI'll definitely keep listening to some songs in the OST, and i love the opening, but i just can't see myself finishing this game any time soon.",

It's more than just a spin-off of Persona 5, it's also a great sequel and has my favorite soundtrack and gameplay mechanics out of the Persona 5 games. Definitely a more intense and action-packed game but it still allows you to take your time and plan out your every move. The combat is a perfect balance between a hack-and-slash game and a turn based RPG, it has all the same strategy of Persona 5 and more. It's not too difficult and it is still a good game for people who are new to the series.",

ARPG esk Dynasty warriors combat system with the persona system was one hell of a unexpected combination that works on a meta level. hope to see a P4 spin off using the their new hybrid engine for combat. considering P3, 4, 5 take place in the same universe, seeing a spin off like strikers would be gold imo. \n\nmy only issue is what they did to NG+ and Extreme(merciless) mode. \n\nDon't read this next part(spoilers)\n\n[spoiler] after beating another false god, NG+ is not unlocked like most other persona games, instead you are thrown into \"post game\" and given a boss rush set of requests with harder nightmare versions before you can face The Reaper, why is this bad you might ask? because in all persona games that feature him, he is a end game optional boss encounter that tends to be the hardest out of all before him, the Reaper does not screw around and forcing players to try and fight him to unlock NG+ is kinda harsh. if you struggle with dire shadows, you wont survive a minute with Reaper, ive been able to beat almost all the Dire shadows as well as prepping a fist full of high tier persona's to take on the Reaper. ive beaten him in every persona game so far, not gonna let him stop me from NG+ but for some people? they will most likely quit. defeating Reaper is also required for merciless mode(extreme) [/spoiler]",

        "content": "This game is great, the characters are stunning, the writing enthralling, the action intoxicating but there are times it feels incomplete, a symptom of being stuck between two genres and having two rather different teams working on this game; the lack of truly unique social links, the absence of first game tie ins (there's no Mishima and I hold a grudge) and if you aren\u2019t fond of the hack n slash genre the repetition in combat and the music that comes with it can be overbearing. \n\nI do recommend the game, you could try and wait for a sale but unfortunately JRPGs, Atlus games, koei games and triple A games generally do not go on sale often enough for waiting to pay off. \n\nI believe if you like hack n slash games, like the Persona franchise, like franchise mixing, or like long games this game is more than worth the price and it is at least the sequel to a masterpiece, if not one itself. \n\nAnd for a much more in depth look into the many aspect of this game be sure to check out my video review of the game at https://youtu.be/LcN9Tlo83uU\n",

By itself the combos are not many, but they are well crafted enough to make it fluid and impactful.\n\nI did not present any issues from my end and I can definetly suggest this game as it has a great story with characters well developed, great gameplay, amazing music, the game is not short and enjoyable.\n\nAdditional note: I am glad to see Atlus bringing their games to PC and giving the PC community some love, I can't wait to see what they have prepared for us in the future",

        "content": "Should you buy it? If you have played Persona 5 then yes, If you have played Persona 5 Royal, I don't think so, I personally think moving from Persona 5 Royal to Persona 5 Strikers is a downgrade but if you want to check out the new characters and some new generic persona 5 story, I am not stopping you. I will say that the new characters are the only ones worthwhile in this game. If you haven't played any Persona 5, then I don't recommend you buy it. The game is good enough to keep you entertain for sure but I doubt you're gonna spend a lot of time unless you're really a die-hard fan who has nothing to do. I do think it is a great game, but I do not think it is worth the price at the moment. I would say wait for the price to go down first. \n\n[h1]Good stuff[/h1]\n[u]New characters[/u]\nThe only reason you should play this game is to check out the 'new aigis' , 'new dojima and his daughter', and the new villains. My favourite villain would be Sapporo's Monarch just because it is kinda rare to see one of the main groups to have a good parent figure for once. The story on the other hand, it is fine but I really don't like they have a plenty of similarities with Persona 5, should've done more like Persona 5 Royal final boss did.\n[u]Music[/u]\nYea, I like Rock music.\n\n[h1]Mixed bag[/h1]\n[u]New combat[/u]\nThis is pretty much the selling point of the game, changing it from turn-based combat to action rpg. I really enjoy in about 28 hours, then I got bored. The combos are repetitive, some enemies just takes too many hits to kill ( esspecially the ones with no weaknesses ) and damn I hate grinding. They do give Arsene have skills up to like level 95, but he doesn't really have any special skills and leveling him up is such a hassle considering leveling up a lvl 40 arsene takes more experience than a regular demon that have base level around 38-42. And in order to gain access to demons with level 67 and above, you need to beat them, and they take too much hits unless you keep grinding. However, I appreciate that they took the time to make this new combat systems. Really hope they bring the system back to make a new Raidou Kuzunoha game or something else because I think Persona should stick to the turn-based combat.\n\n[h1]Bad stuff[/h1]\n[u]Phantom Thieves[/u]\nI know this is a welcome back to Persona 5 fans, but damn the phantom thieves are kinda boring. 'New aigis' and 'new dojima' carried the phantom thieves through the whole game in terms of character development. Give me something new to learn about their characters not bring back their previous problems and relate it to the current villain. Which is one of the reasons Yusuke and Haru are the only ones I kinda liked and enjoyed because Yusuke is a goofball but we actually got to see more of him being serious instead of talking about him being poor and I learned something new about Haru which is her relationship with the villain.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention some of the personas need to be fuse with a the early personas at certain level for example, King Frost - Lvl 40 Jack Frost + Lvl 40 Jack O' Lantern. Jack frost should be around level 20 when you get him, and Jack O Lantern is Level 8, So if you didnt level them up or dont have enough Persona points, it is gonna take some time to get some of the personas.",

The combat felt very satisfying and the story was overall fantastic, even the music was phenomenal. It was indeed a perfect execution of using a new genre for the series. The Persona series never seems to disappoint and I'm glad to enjoy the ride of this series. My verdict of this game will be a solid 9/10. The reasoning for the 9 is just because as much as this game is fantastic, I could definitely see some potential of including DLC like having Akechi or Kasumi as DLC Characters or maybe challenge packs like they did with protagonist of 3 and 4 that was seen in Royal where you can fight them and maybe gain their fusions to make their Personas. But besides that I recommend trying this game at some point if you have no other games to play.",

        "content": "So as a fan of persona 5 I just had to buy strikers and I wanted to do a review for other people who game to this game because of persona 5. I do a pros and cons type of review so I can make it as simple as possible. Now onto the pros\n\n[Pros]\n\n- [Combat]\nI love this games feel for the hack and slash type of game style they did not miss on the feel of combat and the enjoyment of constantly throwing out attacks and dodging.\n\n- [Bond] In the previous persona 5 it was done through spending time with characters and unlocking better skills, In this game it is gained through requests and story progression and is very neat upgrading the exact skills you want to.\n\n- [Personas]\nThey kept a lot of the old personas making it pretty fun seeing the old ones and knowing how to counter them off of memory from the previous game. I also like how in combat you can use the ability's as a combo that doesn't consume SP making the personas more involved since they branched more into melee combat it kept the feel of needing personas relevant.\n\n- [Requests]\nI seen a request and it allowed me to re fight a boss of a jail for a reward which was pretty dope not having to start a new game plus just to fight a certain boss again, which in turn gives the game more replay value without having to new game plus it.\n\n- [Fast Paced Combat] \nI enjoy running around and just slashing at every enemy in sight it makes for a more involved experience so you don't fall asleep while grinding levels as fast.\n\n- [Sequel]\nUnlike jumping from character to character when making a new game they instead made it like a sequel which was promising since I never played the other personas I wanted to relive the feel of the OG phantom thieves in persona 5. Making me want it all the more and I mention this because I have a con later down in the list making this make more sense to the rating.\n\n- [Art Style]\nIt's very unique in the environment inside the metaverse which I can appreciate a very lot since it makes it stand out from other games it makes you wanna keep playing the franchise.\n\nThis is my temporary review since I haven't fully played through and only have 10 hours into the game now onto the cons.\n\n[Cons]\n\n- [Sequel]\nSo far into my gameplay I haven't experienced much freedom which may be because I'm not far enough into the game, I really enjoyed the dating whoever you wanted or deciding what to do with your time. It strayed from the feel of persona 5 which makes this sequel a bit of a disappointment though this is a temporary review so this might change as I get further into the game and comments are enabled so if anyone wants to comment on this explaining how the freedom works I would appreciate that. I very rarely get time to play so it may be awhile till I get to see how it is.\n\n- [EXP] \nI fight almost every single enemy I find and I am still not a high level to where I can go through the area like its on very easy difficulty and that is not very promising for a time limited game time.\n\n- [Time Management]\nThe previous persona made entering and exiting the palaces and mementos much more problematic in this game they don't really worry you since you can go in and out as you please and your days won't end. It completely heals you and your sp is returned making it a lot less fun trying to survive on no hp or sp or even being tactical on how you use your sp/items.\n\nI do think this game will open up a lot of pros as I progress and this one specifically might just start slow but I will be back to update this review as I learn more things about the game.\nAnd this is the end of the review to all the people that stayed and read my review thank you and I hope you have a great day/night :3",

The combat was actually more fun than I thought it would be compared to Persona 5, which really helped make it feel fresher. The story was interesting and the new characters fit in perfectly. \nThe only issue I had with the game was some slight screen tear on cutscenes, but could just be due to my monitor more than anything. \nIf you enjoyed Persona 5 and want something fresh to keep playing, definitely give this a try.",

        "content": "Edit: After the hotfixes the game has been error free and I can recommend this game now. It has worked on everything I have put it on lately and that's a sigh of relief. Enjoy the game! I will not delete the original review because it is important to note issues at launch.\n\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nI want to start off by saying this game is an amazing game and a full 10/10... WHEN IT WORKS! I have a beast of a PC and the game runs super well when it decides to. However the game crashes over and over again. It will do so completely randomly as well. And to me I save every chance I can get and still end up losing 20 minutes to an hour each time. of the 26 hours clocked only 17 are on my file because I have lost that much time in the game due to random crashes. \n\nMost of the crashes occur during loading screens. However I did experience one crash in the middle of dialogue and another in the menu. Again I love this game but after the 12th crash I have decided enough is enough. I will suffer the bugs and crashes to finish this game but I DO NOT suggest anybody even try this game until they fix their crashing issues. As a huge fan of the Megaten series I am severely disappointed in the lack of QA for this game. I only have thios here on steam but I have read reports of the PS4 version also crashing on PS5 so it seems the console ports have issues as well although I would imagine far less. \n\nI appreciate the challenge and old feel of a Dedicated area to save (you can only save in the real world or checkpoints in the Jails) but because of a lack of a Autosave feature the crashes have become unbearable. \n\nMy luck is terrible as it has crashed at the worst possible times for me including after an hour of gameplay that could not be saved between. An autosave would have saved me the anger from losing that. Even then I feel like I have given enough time to this game for it to not just be a one off issue.\n\nFor the love of god I hope Atlus and Sega will FIX THE CRASHES! Unacceptable!\n\nEdit: I switched from my Samsung Evo 970 Plus to my SATA Samsung QVO 860 SSD and the crashes completely stopped. I switched back and it crashed. If you have a laptop with only an NVME drive stray from this game as it bugs out with them. I still think it's the Denuvo DRM lacking support for the NVMe drivers. They need to fix this and last I checked there were no Update patches yet. If they release one I will test and update the review once again.\n\nGame is fantastic though. Just be aware that you need a Outdated ancient technology to avoid crashes. Which is still unacceptable of a positive review. Get this on PS4 instead.\n\n\nMy Specs are\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 3600X\nMSI X470\nNvidia RTX 2060 Super\n32GB 3600MHZ DDR4 Ram\nWindows 10 Pro\n1TB Samsung EVO 970 Plus NVME SSD\n1TB Samsung QVO 860 SATA SSD\nKingston 480GB SATA SSD\n2x 4TB 7200rpm HDDs in Raid 0\n\n(I have tested it on all storage drives and it only crashes consistently on the NVMe drive)",

        "content": "Ware wa nanji\u2026 nanji wa ware\u2026\n\nFirst thing you must know is that the game continues the story of Persona 5 not Royal. No characters,events or ending are mentioned or seen in Strikers from Royal. Bare that in mind. It is a must to know the lore of Persona 5. Either play it or watch a no commentary walkthrough. Anime is not recommended as many things are lost.\n\nStrikers had a drastic change in gameplay from Turn base combat to Hack and Slash which made the game more fast paced and gives you a big window of how you will fight with shadows. As we might remember, Yakuza Like a Dragon also changed it's combat but to Turn Based which was not the best decision.\n\nNow we roam all around Japan to find Jails (Yes, now castles are called jails and they are not a little location but a whole city) and defeat Monarchs that rule them. There is no Memento for obvious reasons. \n\nThe game became very easy in comparison to the previous game. You are not limited with time anymore and can infiltrate jails as many times as you want. You don't need to raise your confidants anymore because there is a new system of Bond. You receive Bond Skill exp for battles,requests,bosses and so. You get points with each level that you can spend on skills that will help you in different ways. The shop is now a;ways in the hideout. One click and you can buy anything you want. You don't need to annoy poor Iwai for equipment or go to Takemi for meds. Ah, you will be hearing \"How many?\" and \"Are you sure?\" a looooooooooot of times, so be prepared. I warned you.\n\nThe story is as always good but there is one moment in the game which makes me question why the devs repeated themselves...\n\nBosses. If you played or watched Persona 5, you do remember that each boss was unique and you had to follow some strategy not to die. Sadly, bosses here are like regular enemies. Nothing special about them. No difficult stategy needed. You just need to mash the buttons and evade. Only the final boss was unique and had something different in the boss fight. \nI'll just give an example of Persona 5 boss. Madarame. Several phases. Painting and then fight with clones where you had to use correct skills to win. Here...just mash the down buttons. Maybe it was made so the game doesn't loose the pace and stays fast like all of the gameplay but these are bosses. When you beat them, you need to get the feeling that you won by doing something and getting the feeling that all the hours you spent to grind for a new persona wasn't just a woosh. \n\nIn general I like the game and it's new combat system. New locations were a nice change of pace and I hope the next game will have something more. Bosses need more attention because this is just a meh. I hope that the new game will have another cool story that I and other Persona fans will enjoy.",

        "content": "I should start this review saying that if you're new to the Persona universe, DO NOT PLAY THIS FIRST. This game is a sequel to the original Persona 5. This game fully assumes that you've played at least the original Persona 5, and doesn't give any background to new players, so play either the original Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal first. I don't care if you have to watch an LP.\n\nAs a huge Persona 5 fan, I preordered this game and completed the story 4 days after it came out, playing nothing but this game. While it is significantly shorter than the original Persona 5, I can say that the combat is some of the most fun I've *ever* had in a game. You can totally feel the passion from this game, and the developers put their heart and soul into making something that will stay true to the Persona 5 vibe and the charm that made people fans of the game to begin with. \n\nNot even mentioning the SOUNDTRACK. This absolute banger of a soundtrack paired with super-intense-stimulus-overloading fights makes for some of the most fun you'll ever have in a hack n' slash game. Of course there are pretty easy to point out flaws with it like the story not being as long or good as the original, but in my opinion the good outweighs the bad for this game. If you loved P5, you will absolutely love this game.",

But it's not worth the awful gameplay. Either get it on console or just look up a Let's Play.",

It also adds to the character of quite a few main characters, which is nice because some of them were sorely lacking in the first Persona 5. \nWith that being said, it's incredibly similar to the first story and I found the final boss to be incredibly underwhelming, both in concept and as an actual fight.  Along with this, the story takes place over the course of a month, but don't let that fool you, there's still a lot of playtime to be had from the game. \nIt lacks a lot of the key elements of the series, like the turn based combat, social links, and time management, so don't go into the game expecting that. It does offer a few unique things to better fit with the style of game, but if you're expecting another Persona 5 Royal, you will be disappointed. \nNot the best game in the franchise, but it's still incredibly enjoyable nonetheless.",

        "content": "great game with a great post game as well which is unusual for any persona game. its basically a warriors game with persona elements which is a lot of fun with the combat forcing you to either pick a general use persona or a persona that has a specific element that can counter the shadows you fight. it should be mentioned that you can control your team members and a lot of times they can handle the fight themselves since they all have excellent movesets.\n\nbiggest problem i have with this game is the persona fusion system. the persona fusion was way more in depth in the normal games than compared to this one as a majority of fusions are dependent on the level of the persona and really the arcana (especially in late game). its pretty annoying to grind PP to level up your late game persona. (I am aware that there methods to circumvent this but still the requirement on levels is annoying).\n\ntl:dr good game ryuji says fuck",

        "content": "[u]Persona 5 Strikers is the best game I have played in 2021. [/u]\n\nHowever, its existence on PC is a harder sell as the game's story is a continuation from the PS3/PS4  game Persona 5. Yes, you can just pick up and play Strikers, but unless you watched the anime, or played the prior game you won't know the characters, their backstory and all of their character nuances and personality traits.\n\n[b]So what is the game?[/b]\n\nIt's a story driven action game with RPG elements. As you play the game you're tasked with infiltrating 'Prisons'. You fight your way through until you defeat the boss at the end. As you progress you collect Personas. Think of these like Pokemon. Each Persona has different skills and abilities. Some heal, some buff or debuff and some do fire, wind or death magic. You level up your characters and persona to increase their power and learn new abilities.\n\n[b]The Good.[/b]\n\n[u]The voice acting. [/u]\n\nThe game isn't 'fully' voice acted. Some sections simply have to be read, however similar to the game this is based on, large sections of the game are fully voice acted and the quality of the voice acting really elevates the game. All of the voice actors from Persona 5 have reprised their roles, with the addition of Nolan North joining the cast as the detective Zenkichi.\n\n[u]The combat. [/u]\n\nThis isn't your typical musou game. Rarely is the screen filled to the brim with enemies. Instead, as you traverse the area, you will see enemies roaming around. You can choose to avoid them or 'ambush' them for a tactical advantage. Combat then starts with a small group of enemies to defeat. The combat is fast and satisfying, blending in a range of melee combos, ranged weapon attacks and abilities (think spells). Enemies often have weaknesses that can be exploited, leading to the opportunity to deal massive damage.\n\n[u]Music.[/u]\n\nThis is obviously a personal preference. I like the Persona 5 music a lot. The Striker's soundtrack builds upon the existing soundtrack making slight changes, such as heavier guitar riffs.  The only glaring example here is the first 'prison' stage. The music is a stark contrast to the rest of the game. It's akin to something you might hear on a pachinko or slot machine. It's loud, noisy and is particularly grating on the ears. \n\nMy personal preference is to use the DLC which allows you to use combat music from all of the previous Persona games. As a fan of the Persona series, I'll always choose to engage in combat with Mass Destruction playing.\n\n[b]The Ok.[/b]\n\n[u]Story.[/u]\n\nThe story of the game is in a weird place. Persona 5 Strikers is the story sequel to Persona 5, but not Persona 5 Royal. That means that none of the events of P5R have taken place. Not game breaking, but something to consider. The story itself is fine, if not a little predictable. It's welcome that the characters continue to develop past the P5 story. Hearing Haru refer to herself as 'Beauty Thief' again was welcome.\n\n[u]Fighting when?[/u]\n\nPersona 5 has a lot of story. Some of it is voice acted but a majority of it is reading conversations between The Phantom Thieves. Sometimes you just want to get back into the action, but you'll need to wade through the story elements first. I personally liked the story, but some people might not expect this much from a fighting game. Be warned.\n\n[b]The Ugly.[/b]\n\n[u]Eternal Bonds.[/u]\n\nMy only real criticism of the game came from my desire to 100% it. In particular, one Achievement stands out as egregious, and that is \"Eternal Bonds'. To get this achievement, you need to raise your Bond level in game to 99. Raising your bond level happens as you play the game. Major story events, killing rare bounties and defeating bosses will all net you some bond level. However, I completed the game around the 48 hour mark. I then started new game plus and played through it again. Even after two complete playthroughs, I still didn't have enough. \nI grinded one particular rare bounty for about 10 more hours. In hindsight, I could have played NG+ on the hardest difficulty, but I did so up until completing Alice's Palace, but the progress on the bond levels didn't seem any faster.\nSo there's a reason only ~3% of all players have completed all of the Achievements. It's due to Eternal Bonds. If you plan on grinding bond levels, be prepared to do a lot of this:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0x5VNsTkQ \n\nIn the end, I did 100% Persona 5 Strikers. It's one of the few games I've sought to do so with. I still maintain it's the best game I have played all year and I do recommend it.",

        "content": "This is by far the best Persona spin off, outshining even the Persona Q series. The game's fighting mechanics are really fun, and each of the playable characters have fun movesets. New features such as leveling up Personas using Persona Points feel right at home for the series. Plus, for the first time in Persona history, the game can actually be difficult. Hard mode is ACTUALLY hard! It almost feels like a real Shin Megami Tensei game in terms of difficulty. In terms of story, this works very well as a sequel to the original Persona 5. All of the characters are enjoyable (except for Morgana, rot in hell you little shit) and feel like they're the same characters that I got to know so well in the original. The new characters such as Sophia and Zenkichi are phenomenal additions to the cast. The only problem in terms of characters is that there's no Goro Akechi or Sumi Yoshizawa, but that makes sense. Atlus, just please include those two as DLC. All in all, I love this game, and I hope Atlus continues to add more to it!",

        "content": "Well to sum it up:\n\nPros:\n- It's Warrior series mix with persona at core, so if you fans of both, you gonna be satisfied with this game\n- The persona use in the gameplay is satisfying, and actually make it feel different from other warrior games\n- The new character, stories, and dialogue is still persona-standard, enjoyable and well written (even though the social aspect is missing)\n\nCon:\n- Still warrior game flaws, the feeling when hitting enemies is not good enough, i feel just like fighting a bunch of cotton\n- The missing of private social interaction with others\n\nOveral this game is enjoyable if you are a warrior series and persona fan, but if you rather new on persona series, i suggest playing persona 4 golden , or just wait for persona 5 port in pc",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers, while not like other games in the series, is still an incredible game in my eyes.\nSPOILERS BELOW\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nIn terms of gameplay, Strikers is akin to Hyrule Warriors, with the aspects of Persona gameplay mixed in. There are 4 difficulties; easy, normal, hard, and merciless, which is only available in NG+. Personally, I played on hard mode up until the Osaka jail, because by then, it took me around 30 minutes or so to clear out certain prison keeps. Normal is a good difficulty for people who are possibly new to the action format (such as myself) and I have not tried easy, but given that its easier than normal, its most likely forgiving. The aspects of normal Persona mixed with action style gameplay is interesting, but in my experience, it is very rinse and repeat. Honestly, I couldn't do too many of the special moves or master arts, because enemies always hit me down before I could finish them. It was much easier to charge Joker's gun, or just spam whatever the enemy was weak to. As for the requests and jails, it's a mixed bag for me. The requests are decent, and dont take much time to complete, but that's about it. The jails are interesting, but unlike Persona 5, they don't offer many hiding spaces for ambushes, causing you to have to either be ambushed, shoot an enemy from far away, or attempt a direct hit. However, they are more action packed in my opinion. Using the environment to do phantom dash attacks are quite nice and can create cool combos if you can use them correctly. All in all, the gameplay isn't bad, but it isn't spectacular either. My biggest complaints are that A. you can only see the telegraph for an enemy's attack if you are facing them, and B. you MUST be locked on if you want to quickly use a magic attack and keep the flow of your fight. I would, however, definitely play this over almost any triple A game made today.\n\nAs for the story, it essentially follows that of Persona 5. As a direct sequel (or spinoff? Royal makes things weird.), it takes place after the collapse of the Metaverse and after the Antisocial Force's semi-disbandment. Personally, I think that Strikers has a few loopholes that I won't go too deep into, but it does have some \"aha\" moments, but also some poorly instigated moments that just feel like a plot device. The story is still alluring, and I was invested the whole time, but some parts could have been a little fleshed out. The interactions between the Thieves were nice, however, which is one of the main things I like in Persona games.\n\nThe last part I'll probably talk about is formatting, graphics, ect. Frame cap is 60 fps which isnt the end of the world, but I did notice that Yusuke's showtime did lag out my computer occasionally, and sometimes when the camera pans out to a birds eye view or a showcase of the palace, there were glitched out portions of the screen, but that wasn't anything too bad. Nothing compared to the infinite loading screen I got on my rematch of the final boss :( But regardless, the game looks nice, obviously similar to that of the original Persona 5. The menus are nice, and the game has a lot of color.\n\nAll in all, I would still say this game is one of if not my favorite games on Steam, and for good reason. Every game has its flaws, but the world of Persona will always hold a special place in my heart.\n\nPlus the music, too. Just buy the bonus content and listen to Counterstrike forever. Songs a banger.",
