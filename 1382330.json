        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

        "content": "Im not usually a big fan of games with gameplay like this but my love for Persona 5 mandated I check this out and honestly, I came away very impressed. The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative.

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

        "content": "Im not usually a big fan of games with gameplay like this but my love for Persona 5 mandated I check this out and honestly, I came away very impressed. The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative.

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

        "content": "Im not usually a big fan of games with gameplay like this but my love for Persona 5 mandated I check this out and honestly, I came away very impressed. The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative.

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

        "content": "Im not usually a big fan of games with gameplay like this but my love for Persona 5 mandated I check this out and honestly, I came away very impressed. The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative.

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

        "content": "Im not usually a big fan of games with gameplay like this but my love for Persona 5 mandated I check this out and honestly, I came away very impressed. The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative.

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

        "content": "Im not usually a big fan of games with gameplay like this but my love for Persona 5 mandated I check this out and honestly, I came away very impressed. The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative.

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

        "content": "Im not usually a big fan of games with gameplay like this but my love for Persona 5 mandated I check this out and honestly, I came away very impressed. The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative.

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

        "content": "Im not usually a big fan of games with gameplay like this but my love for Persona 5 mandated I check this out and honestly, I came away very impressed. The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative.

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

        "content": "Im not usually a big fan of games with gameplay like this but my love for Persona 5 mandated I check this out and honestly, I came away very impressed. The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative.

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

        "content": "Im not usually a big fan of games with gameplay like this but my love for Persona 5 mandated I check this out and honestly, I came away very impressed. The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative.

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

        "content": "Im not usually a big fan of games with gameplay like this but my love for Persona 5 mandated I check this out and honestly, I came away very impressed. The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative.

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

        "content": "Im not usually a big fan of games with gameplay like this but my love for Persona 5 mandated I check this out and honestly, I came away very impressed. The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative.

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

        "content": "Im not usually a big fan of games with gameplay like this but my love for Persona 5 mandated I check this out and honestly, I came away very impressed. The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative.

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

        "content": "Im not usually a big fan of games with gameplay like this but my love for Persona 5 mandated I check this out and honestly, I came away very impressed. The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative.

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

        "content": "Im not usually a big fan of games with gameplay like this but my love for Persona 5 mandated I check this out and honestly, I came away very impressed. The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative.

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

        "content": "Im not usually a big fan of games with gameplay like this but my love for Persona 5 mandated I check this out and honestly, I came away very impressed. The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative.

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

        "content": "Im not usually a big fan of games with gameplay like this but my love for Persona 5 mandated I check this out and honestly, I came away very impressed. The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative.

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

        "content": "Im not usually a big fan of games with gameplay like this but my love for Persona 5 mandated I check this out and honestly, I came away very impressed. The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative.

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

        "content": "Im not usually a big fan of games with gameplay like this but my love for Persona 5 mandated I check this out and honestly, I came away very impressed. The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative.

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

        "content": "Im not usually a big fan of games with gameplay like this but my love for Persona 5 mandated I check this out and honestly, I came away very impressed. The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative.

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

        "content": "Im not usually a big fan of games with gameplay like this but my love for Persona 5 mandated I check this out and honestly, I came away very impressed. The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative.

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

        "content": "Im not usually a big fan of games with gameplay like this but my love for Persona 5 mandated I check this out and honestly, I came away very impressed. The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative.

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

        "content": "Im not usually a big fan of games with gameplay like this but my love for Persona 5 mandated I check this out and honestly, I came away very impressed. The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative.

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

        "content": "Im not usually a big fan of games with gameplay like this but my love for Persona 5 mandated I check this out and honestly, I came away very impressed. The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative.

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

        "content": "Im not usually a big fan of games with gameplay like this but my love for Persona 5 mandated I check this out and honestly, I came away very impressed. The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative.

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

        "content": "As someone who loved Persona 5, I'd love to recommend this game and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into its development on its original console systems. However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

        "content": "if you have a Intel 12th gen cpu or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game will barely run at about 3 to 17 fps no matter your settings with severe stutters that lead to crashes. This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAfter some doctoring (that really shouldn't be neccessary), time to actually play the game",

The gang getting back together and going on a road trip to save the world was a novel idea, and for me it worked. It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",
